Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line trough the centre. Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
In the world of entertainment, TV talk shows have undoubtedly flooded every inch of space on daytime television. And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one varies in style and format. But no two shows are more profoundly opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows.
Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of “trash talk (废话)”. The topics on his show are as shocking as shocking can be. For example, the show takes the ever-common talk show themes of love, sex, cheating, guilt, hate, conflict and morality to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is a display and exploitation of society’s moral catastrophes (灾难), yet people are willing to eat up the intriguing predicaments (困境) of other people’s lives.
Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its extreme, but Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show focuses on the improvement of society and an individual’s quality of life. Topics range from teaching your children responsibility, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.
Compared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being dumped on society. Jerry ends every show with a “final word”. He makes a small speech that sums up the entire moral of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.
Clean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show’s main target audiences are middle-class Americans. Most of these people have the time, money, and stability to deal with life’s tougher problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of an association with the young adults of society. These are 18-to 21-year-olds whose main troubles in life involve love, relationship, sex, money and peers. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned underneath the show’s exploitation.
While the two shows are as different as night and day, both have ruled the talk show circuit for many years now. Each one caters to a different audience while both have a strong following from large groups of fans. Ironically, both could also be considered pioneers in the talk show world.
21. Compared with other TV talk shows, both the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey are ________.
A) more family-oriented
B) unusually popular
C) more profound
D) relatively formal
22. Though the social problems Jerry Springer talks about appear distasteful, the audience ________.
A) remain fascinated by them
B) are ready to face up to them
C) remain indifferent to them
D) are willing to get involved in them
23. Which of the following is likely to be a topic of the Oprah Winfrey show?
A) A new type of robot.
B) Racist hatred.
C) Family budget planning.
D) Street violence.
24. Despite their different approaches, the two talk shows are both ________.
A) ironical
B) sensitive
C) instructive
D) cynical
25. We can learn from the passage that the two talk shows ________.
A) have monopolized the talk show circuit
B) exploit the weaknesses in human nature
C) appear at different times of the day
D) are targeted at different audiences
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
To understand the marketing concept, it is only necessary to understand the difference between marketing and selling. Not too many years ago, most industries concentrated primarily on the efficient production of goods, and then relied on “persuasive salesmanship” to move as much of these goods as possible. Such production and selling focuses on the needs of the seller to produce goods and then convert them into money.
Marketing, on the other hand, focuses on the wants of consumers. It begins with first analyzing the preferences and demands of consumers and then producing goods that will satisfy them. This eye-on-the-consumer approach is known as the marketing concept, which simply means that instead of trying to sell whatever is easiest to produce or buy for resale, the makers and dealers first endeavor to find out what the consumer wants to buy and then go about making it available for purchase.
This concept does not imply that business is benevolent (慈善的) or that consumer satisfaction is given priority over profit in a company. There are always two sides to every business transaction-the firm and the customer-and each must be satisfied before trade occurs. Successful merchants and producers, however, recognize that the surest route to profit is through understanding and catering to customers. A striking example of the importance of catering to the consumer presented itself in mid-1985, when Coca Cola changed the flavor of its drink. The non-acceptance of the new flavor by a significant portion of the public brought about a prompt restoration of the Classic Coke, which was then marketed alongside the new. King Customer ruled!
26. The marketing concept discussed in the passage is, in essence, ________.
A) the practice of turning goods into money
B) making goods available for purchase
C) the customer-centred approach
D) a form of persuasive salesmanship
27. What was the main concern of industrialists before the marketing concept was widely accepted?
A) The needs of the market.
B) The efficiency of production.
C) The satisfaction of the user.
D) The preferences of the dealer.
28. According to the passage, “to move as much of these goods as possible” (Lines 3-4, Para. 1) means “________”.
A) to sell the largest possible amount of goods
B) to transport goods as efficiently as possible
C) to dispose of these goods in large quantities
D) to redesign these goods for large-scale production
29. What does the restoration of the Classic Coke best illustrate?
A) Traditional goods have a stronger appeal to the majority of people.
B) It takes time for a new product to be accepted by the public.
C) Consumers with conservative tastes are often difficult to please.
D) Products must be designed to suit the taste of the consumer.
30. In discussing the marketing concept, the author focuses on ________.
A) its main characteristic
B) its social impact
C) its possible consequence
D) its theoretical basis
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Conventional wisdom about conflict seems pretty much cut and dried. Too little conflict breeds apathy (冷漠) and stagnation (呆滞). Too much conflict leads to divisiveness (分裂) and hostility. Moderate levels of conflict, however, can spark creativity and motivate people in a healthy and competitive way.
Recent research by Professor Charles R. Schwenk, however, suggests that the optimal level of conflict may be more complex to determine than these simple generalizations. He studied perceptions of conflict among a sample of executives. Some of the executives worked for profit-seeking organizations and others for not-for-profit organizations.
Somewhat surprisingly, Schwenk found that opinions about conflict varied systematically as a function of the type of organization. Specifically, managers in not-for-profit organizations strongly believed that conflict was beneficial to their organizations and that it promoted higher quality decision making than might be achieved in the absence of conflict.
Managers of for-profit organizations saw a different picture. They believed that conflict generally was damaging and usually led to poor-quality decision making in their organizations. Schwenk interpreted these results in terms of the criteria for effective decision making suggested by the executives. In the profit-seeking organizations, decision-making effectiveness was most often assessed in financial terms. The executives believed that consensus rather than conflict enhanced financial indicators.
In the not-for-profit organizations, decision-making effectiveness was defined from the perspective of satisfying constituents. Given the complexities and ambiguities associated with satisfying many diverse constituents executives perceived that conflict led to more considered and acceptable decisions.
31. In the eyes of the author, conventional opinion on conflict is ________.
A) wrong
B) oversimplified
C) misleading
D) unclear
32. Professor Charles R. Schwenk’s research shows ________.
A) the advantages and disadvantages of conflict
B) the real value of conflict
C) the difficulty in determining the optimal level of conflict
D) the complexity of defining the roles of conflict
33. We can learn from Schwenk’s research that ________.
A) a person’s view of conflict is influenced by the purpose of his organization
B) conflict is necessary for managers of for-profit organizations
C) different people resolve conflicts in different ways
D) it is impossible for people to avoid conflict
34. The passage suggests that in for-profit organizations ________.
A) there is no end of conflict
B) expression of different opinions is encouraged
C) decisions must be justifiable
D) success lies in general agreement
35. People working in a not-for-profit organization ________.
A) seem to be difficult to satisfy
B) are free to express diverse opinions
C) are less effective in making decisions
D) find it easier to reach agreement
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Imagine eating everything delicious you want-with none of the fat. That would be great, wouldn’t it?
New “fake fat” products appeared on store shelves in the United States recently, but not everyone is happy about it. Makers of the products, which contain a compound called olestra, say food manufacturers can now eliminate fat from certain foods. Critics, however, say the new compound can rob the body of essential vitamins and nutrients (营养物) and can also cause unpleasant side effects in some people. So it’s up to decide whether the new fat-free products taste good enough to keep eating.
Chemists discovered olestra in the late 1960s, when they were searching for a fat that could be digested by infants more easily. Instead of finding the desired fat, the researchers created a fat that can’t be digested at all.
Normally, special chemicals in the intestines (肠) “grab” molecules of regular fat and break them down so they can be used by the body. A molecule of regular fat is made up of three molecules of substances called fatty acids.
The fatty acids are absorbed by the intestines and bring with them the essential vitamins A, D, E, and K. When fat molecules are present in the intestines with any of those vitamins, the vitamins attach to the molecules and are carried into the bloodstream.
Olestra, which is made from six to eight molecules of fatty acids, is too large for the intestines to absorb. It just slides through the intestines without being broken down. Manufacturers say it’s that ability to slide unchanged through the intestines that makes olestra so valuable as a fat substitute. It provides consumers with the taste of regular fat without any bad effects on the body. But critics say olestra can prevent vitamins A, D, E, and K from being absorbed. It can also prevent the absorption of carotenoids (类胡萝卜素), compounds that may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease, etc.
Manufacturers are adding vitamins A, D, E, and K as well as carotenoids to their products now. Even so, some nutritionists are still concerned that people might eat unlimited amounts of food made with the fat substitute without worrying about how many calories they are consuming.
36. We learn from the passage that olestra is a substance that ________.
A) contains plenty of nutrients
B) renders foods calorie-free while retaining their vitamins
C) makes foods easily digestible
D) makes foods fat-free while keeping them delicious
37. The result of the search for an easily digestible fat turned out to be ________.
A) commercially useless
B) just as anticipated
C) somewhat controversial
D) quite unexpected
38. Olestra is different from ordinary fats in that ________.
A) it passes through the intestines without being absorbed
B) it facilitates the absorption of vitamins by the body
C) it helps reduce the incidence of heart disease
D) it prevents excessive intake of vitamins
39. What is a possible negative effect of olestra according to some critics?
A) It may impair the digestive system.
B) It may affect the overall fat intake.
C) It may increase the risk of cancer.
D) It may spoil the consumers’ appetite.
40. Why are nutritionists concerned about adding vitamins to olestra?
A) It may lead to the over-consumption of vitamins.
B) People may be induced to eat more than is necessary.
C) The function of the intestines may be weakened.
D) It may trigger a new wave of fake food production.

Until the very latest moment of his existence, man has been bound to the planet on which he originated and developed. Now he had the capability to leave that planet (71) and move out into the universe to those worlds which he has known previously only directly. Men have explored parts of (72) the moon, put spaceships in orbit around another planet and possibly within the decade will land into another planet and (73) explore it. Can we be too bold as to suggest that we may be (74) able to colonize other planet within the not―too―distant (75) future? Some have advocated such a procedure as a solution to the population problem. ship the excess people off to the moon. But we must keep in head the billions of dollars we (76) might spend in carrying out the project. To maintain the earth’s population at its present level. we would have to blast off into space 7,500 people every hour of every day of the year.
Why are we spending so little money on space (77) exploration? Consider the great need for improving many (78) aspects of the global environment, one is surely justified in his concern for the money and resources that they are poured (79) into the space exploration efforts. But perhaps we should look at both sides of the coin before arriving hasty (80) conclusions.

How I Finance My College Education
With the rapid development of higher education in China, and more high school graduates admitted, universities can no longer be financed exclusively by the government and students must pay at least partly for their schooling.
There are various ways for a student to pay his tuition and fees. To begin with, if the student is quite excellent in his studies, he can apply for scholarship. Secondly, especially in China, he can always depend on his parents for all kinds of expenditure, including living allowances. Then, he can choose to turn to the bank for a loan to pay his way through university, which he can repay after graduation. If he finds all the above not desirable, he still had another road to take-to do a part-time job and work his way through.
In my case, I am fortunate enough to be born into a well-to-do family and have no difficulty having my parents pay for all my fees. But as a college student, I dislike a totally dependent existence, so I am working part-time as a newspaper-boy to help support myself. And I am also studying hard, hoping to win some scholarship or awards one day so that I can be wholly self-reliant and independent.

Passage 1
Most people know what a hot dog is. It’s a sausage in a roll. But do you know why it’s called a hot dog? Well, the long red sausage which goes into a hotdog is called a Frankfurter. It got its name from the German town Frankfurt. The sausages were very popular, but hot frankfurters were difficult to sell in crowds. One man, Harry Stevens, had the job of feeding the crowds in baseball games. He had an idea. Why not put the frankfurters in long, hot bread rolls? This made them easy to sell. The “red hot” had a hot and attractive taste and became very popular. But in 1903, an American cartoonist drew a long German sausage dog in place of the frankfurter so a frankfurter in a roll soon became known as a “hot dog”. It was a joke, but some people really thought the sausages contained dog meat. For a while, sales of hotdogs failed, but not for long.
11. What is a frankfurter?
12. What was Harry Stevens’ job?
13. Why did sales of hot dogs decrease for some time?
Passage 2
We all scream for water when thirsty, but do you know in very hot, dry weather, plants also make faint sounds―as if they are crying out for help?
You see, in a plant’s stem there are hundreds of “water pipes” that bring water and minerals from the soil all the way up to the leaves. As the ground turns dry, it becomes harder and harder for the plants to do this.
In severe droughts, plants have to fight to pull out any water available. Scientist Robert winter has found out that when it is really bad their water pipes snap from the tension like rubber bands. When that happens, the whole plant vibrates a little. The snapping pipes make noises ten thousand times more quiet than a whisper.
Robert knows that healthy, well-watered plants are quiet. He also knows that many insects prefer attacking dry plants rather than healthy plants. How do the insects know which are healthy plants and which are not? Robert thinks that the insects may listen for the plants that cry and then they may buzz in to kill.
To test his theory, Robert is using a device that can imitate plant cries. He attaches it to a quiet, healthy plant so the plant sounds thirsty. Then he watches insects to see if they attack more often than usual.
If he is right, scientists could use the insects’ ability against them. They could build traps that imitate crying plants. So when the insects buzz in to eat, they won’t buzz out.
14. What do plants do when they are thirsty?
15. What plants do many insects tend to attack?
16. What could scientists do if Robert’s theory proves to be true?
Passage 3
People enjoy taking trips, but what are the reasons they leave home? One reason is for education. People travel because they want to broaden their horizons to learn about other people and other places. They are curious about other cultures. When people are tourists, they get a quick look at different ways of living. Even a short look at another kind of lifestyle is an important lesson.
On a trip, a person can learn directly―by visiting museums and historic spots. What does a tourist learn who sees the art museums, visits the historical palaces and other scenic spots in Paris, and shops along the River Seine? He gets a vivid picture―a real-life―one of the French people. He learns about their attitudes, how they feel about business, beauty and history.
What about the tourist who goes to Hong Kong? Does he get the same information that he could get from a book? he might read that Hong Kong is crowded, that there is less than 200 square meters of space for each person, but seeing and feeling the lack of space will impress him much more. He might read that there are nearly 200 vehicles for every kilometer of roadway, but the sight of so many vehicles parked along the roadside will be a much more vivid lesson. The tourist to Hong Kong will never forget the contrasts―the straight vertical lines of the tall modern buildings and the moving lines of boats that people live in.
17. Why do people leave home to travel according to the passage?
18. What do we learn from the passage about Paris?
19. What impression will a tourist get of Hong Kong?
20. What does the passage tell us about travelling?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
In the 1920s demand for American farm products fell, as European countries began to recover from World War I and instituted austerity (紧缩) programs to reduce their imports. The result was a sharp drop in farm prices. This period was more disastrous for farmers than earlier times had been, because farmers were no longer self-sufficient. They were paying for machinery, seed, and fertilizer, and they were also buying consumer goods. The prices of the items farmers bought remained constant, while prices they received for their products fell. These developments were made worse by the Great Depression, which began in 1929 and extended throughout the 1939s.
In 1929, under President Herbert Hoover, the Federal Farm Board was organized. It established the principle of direct interference with supply and demand, and it represented the first national commitment to provide greater economic stability for farmers.
President Hoover’s successor attached even more importance to this problem. One of the first measures proposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt when he took office in 1933 was the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which was subsequently passed by Congress. This law gave the Secretary of Agriculture the power to reduce production through voluntary agreements with farmers who were paid to take their land out of use. A deliberate scarcity of farm products was planned in an effort to raise prices. This law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on the grounds that general taxes were being collected to pay one special group of people. However, new laws were passed immediately that achieved the same result of resting soil and providing flood-control measures, but which were based on the principle of soil conservation. The Roosevelt Administration believed that rebuilding the nation’s soil was in the national interest and was not simply a plan to help farmers at the expense of other citizens. Later the government guaranteed loans to farmers so that they could buy farm machinery, hybrid (杂交) grain, and fertilizers.
21. What brought about the decline in the demand for American farm products?
A) The impact of the Great Depression.
B) The shrinking of overseas markets.
C) The destruction caused by the First World War.
D) The increased exports of European countries.
22. The chief concern of the American government in the area of agriculture in the 1920s was ________.
A) to increase farm production
B) to establish agricultural laws
C) to prevent farmers from going bankrupt
D) to promote the mechanization of agriculture
23. The Agricultural Adjustment Act encouraged American farmers to ________.
A) reduce their scale of production
B) make full use of their land
C) adjust the prices of their farm products
D) be self-sufficient in agricultural production
24. The Supreme Court rejected the Agricultural Adjustment Act because it believed that the Act ________.
A) might cause greater scarcity of farm products
B) didn’t give the Secretary of Agriculture enough power
C) would benefit neither the government nor the farmers
D) benefited one group of citizens at the expense of others
25. It was claimed that the new laws passed during the Roosevelt Administration were aimed at ________.
A) reducing the cost of farming
B) conserving soil in the long-term interest of the nation
C) lowering the burden of farmers
D) helping farmers without shifting the burden onto other taxpayers
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
In the 1950s, the pioneers of artificial intelligence (AI) predicted that, by the end of this century, computers would be conversing with us at work and robots would be performing our housework. But as useful as computers are, they’re nowhere close to achieving anything remotely resembling these early aspirations for humanlike behavior. Never mind something as complex as conversation: the most powerful computers struggle to reliably recognize the shape of an object, the most elementary of tasks for a ten-month-old kid.
A growing group of AI researchers think they know where the field went wrong. The problem, the scientists say, is that AI has been trying to separate the highest, most abstract levels of thought, like language and mathematics, and to duplicate them with logical, step-by-step programs. A new movement in AI, on the other hand, takes a closer look at the more roundabout way in which nature came up with intelligence. Many of these researchers study evolution and natural adaptation instead of formal logic and conventional computer programs. Rather than digital computers and transistors, some want to work with brain cells and proteins. The results of these early efforts are as promising as they are peculiar, and the new nature-based AI movement is slowly but surely moving to the forefront of the field.
Imitating the brain’s neural (神经的) network is a huge step in the right direction, says computer scientist and biophysicist Michael Conrad, but it still misses an important aspect of natural intelligence. “People tend to treat the brain as if it were made up of color-coded transistors”, he explains, “but it’s not simply a clever network of switches. There are lots of important things going on inside the brain cells themselves.” Specifically, Conrad believes that many of the brain’s capabilities stem from the pattern recognition proficiency of the individual molecules that make up each brain cell. The best way to build and artificially intelligent device, he claims, would be to build it around the same sort of molecular skills.
Right now, the option that conventional computers and software are fundamentally incapable of matching the processes that take place in the brain remains controversial. But if it proves true, then the efforts of Conrad and his fellow AI rebels could turn out to be the only game in town.
26. The author says that the powerful computers of today ________.
A) are capable of reliably recognizing the shape of an object
B) are close to exhibiting humanlike behavior
C) are not very different in their performance from those of the 50’s
D) still cannot communicate with people in a human language
27. The new trend in artificial intelligence research stems from ________.
A) the shift of the focus of study on to the recognition of the shapes of objects
B) the belief that human intelligence cannot be duplicated with logical, step-by-step programs
C) the aspirations of scientists to duplicate the intelligence of a ten-month-old child
D) the efforts made by scientists in the study of the similarities between transistors and brain cells
28. Conrad and his group of AI researchers have been making enormous efforts to ________.
A) find a roundabout way to design powerful computers
B) build a computer using a clever network of switches
C) find out how intelligence developed in nature
D) separate the highest and most abstract levels of thought
29. What’s the author’s opinion about the new AI movement?
A) It has created a sensation among artificial intelligence researchers but will soon die out.
B) It’s a breakthrough in duplicating human thought processes.
C) It’s more like a peculiar game rather than a real scientific effort.
D) It may prove to be in the right direction though nobody is sure of its future prospects.
30. Which of the following is closest in meaning to the phrase “the only game in town” (Line 3, Para. 4)?
A) The only approach to building an artificially intelligent computer.
B) The only way for them to win a prize in artificial intelligence research.
C) The only area worth studying in computer science.
D) The only game they would like to play in town.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:
Cars account for half the oil consumed in the U.S., about half the urban pollution and one fourth the greenhouse (温室) gases. They take a similar toll of (损耗) resources in other industrial nations and in the cities of the developing world. As vehicle use continues to increase in the coming decade, the U.S. and other countries will have to deal with these issues or else face unacceptable economic, health-related and political costs. It is unlikely that oil prices will remain at their current low level or that other nations will accept a large and growing U.S. contribution to global climatic change.
Policymakers and industry have four options: reduce vehicle use, increase the efficiency and reduce the emissions of conventional gasoline-powered vehicles, switch to less harmful fuels, or find less polluting driving systems. The last of these―in particular the introduction of vehicles powered by electricity―is ultimately the only sustainable option. The other alternatives are attractive in theory but in practice are either impractical or offer only marginal improvements. For example, reduced vehicle use could solve traffic problems and a host of social and environmental problems, but evidence from around the world suggests that it is very difficult to make people give up their cars to any significant extent. In the U.S., mass-transit ridership and carpooling (合伙用车) have declined since World War II. Even in Western Europe, with fuel prices averaging more than $1 a liter (about $4 a gallon) and with easily accessible mass transit and dense populations, cars still account for 80 percent of all passenger travel.
Improved energy efficiency is also appealing, but automotive fuel economy has barely made any progress in 10 years. Alternative fuels such as natural gas, burned in internal-combustion engines, could be introduced at relatively low cost, but they would lead to only marginal reductions in pollution and greenhouse emissions (especially because oil companies are already spending billions of dollars every year to develop less polluting types of gasoline).
31. From the passage we know that the increased use of cars will ________.
A) consume half of the oil produced in the world
B) have serious consequences for the well-being of all nations
C) widen the gap between the developed and developing countries
D) impose an intolerable economic burden on residents of large cities
32. The U.S. has to deal with the problems arising from vehicle use because ________.
A) most Americans are reluctant to switch to public transportation systems
B) the present level of oil prices is considered unacceptable
C) other countries will protest its increasing greenhouse emissions
D) it should take a lead in conserving natural resources
33. Which of the following is the best solution to the problems mentioned in the passage?
A) The designing of highly efficient car engines.
B) A reduction of vehicle use in cities.
C) The development of electric cars.
D) The use of less polluting fuels.
34. Which of the following is practical but only makes a marginal contribution to solving the problem of greenhouse emissions?
A) The use of fuels other than gasoline.
B) Improved energy efficiency.
C) The introduction of less polluting driving systems.
D) Reducing car use by carpooling.
35. Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?
A) The decline of public transportation accounts for increased car use in Western Europe.
B) Cars are popular in Western Europe even though fuel prices are fairly high.
C) The reduction of vehicle use is the only sustainable option in densely populated Western Europe.
D) Western European oil companies cannot sustain the cost of developing new-type fuels.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Reebok executives do not like to hear their stylish athletic shoes called “footwear for yuppies (雅皮士,少壮高薪职业人士)”. They contend that Reebok shoes appeal to diverse market segments, especially now that the company offers basketball and children’s shoes for the under-18 set and walking shoes for older customers not interested in aerobics (健身操) or running. The executives also point out that through recent acquisitions they have added hiking boots, dress and casual shoes, and high-performance athletic footwear to their product lines, all of which should attract new and varied groups of customers.
Still, despite its emphasis on new markets, Reebok plans few changes in the upmarket (高档消费人群的) retailing network that helped push sales to $1 billion annually, ahead of all other sports shoe marketers. Reebok shoes, which are priced from $27 to $85, will continue to be sold only in better specialty, sporting goods, and department stores, in accordance with the company’s view that consumers judge the quality of the brand by the quality of its distribution.
In the past few years, the Massachusetts-based company has imposed limits on the number of its distributors (and the number of shoes supplied to stores), partly out of necessity. At times the unexpected demand for Reebok’s exceeded supply, and the company could barely keep up with orders from the dealers it already had. These fulfillment problems seem to be under control now, but the company is still selective about its distributors. At present, Reebok shoes are available in about five thousand retail stores in the United States.
Reebok has already anticipated that walking shoes will be the next fitness-related craze, replacing aerobics shoes the same way its brightly colored, soft leather exercise footwear replaced conventional running shoes. Through product diversification and careful market research, Reebok hopes to avoid the distribution problems Nike came across several years ago, when Nike misjudged the strength of the aerobics shoe craze and was forced to unload huge inventories of running shoes through discount stores.
36. One reason why Reebok’s managerial personnel don’t like their shoes to be called “footwear for yuppies” is that ________.
A) they believe that their shoes are popular with people of different age groups
B) new production lines have been added to produce inexpensive shoes
C) “yuppies” usually evokes a negative image
D) the term makes people think of prohibitive prices
37. Reebok’s view that “consumers judge the quality of the brand by the quality of its distribution” (Line 5, Para. 2) implies that ________.
A) the quality of a brand is measured by the service quality of the store selling it
B) the quality of a product determines the quality of its distributors
C) the popularity of a brand is determined by the stores that sell it
D) consumers believe that first-rate products are only sold by high-quality stores
38. Reebok once had to limit the number of its distributors because ________.
A) its supply of products fell short of demand
B) too many distributors would cut into its profits
C) the reduction of distributors could increase its share of the market
D) it wanted to enhance consumer confidence in its products
39. Although the Reebok Company has solved the problem of fulfilling its orders, it ________.
A) does not want to further expand its retailing network
B) still limits the number of shoes supplied to stores
C) is still particular about who sells its products
D) still carefully chooses the manufacturers of its products
40. What lesson has Reebok learned from Nike’s distribution problems?
A) A company should not sell its high quality shoes in discount stores.
B) A company should not limit its distribution network.
C) A company should do follow-up surveys of its products.
D) A company should correctly evaluate the impact of a new craze on the market.

Part IV Error Correction (15 minutes)
Directions: This part consists of a short passage. In this passage, there are altogether 10 mistakes, one in each numbered line. You may have to change a word, add a word or delete a word. Mark out the mistakes and put the corrections in the blanks provided. If you change a word, cross it out and write the correct word in the corresponding blank. If you add a word, put an insertion mark (∧) in the right place and write the missing word in the blank. If you delete a word, cross it and put a slash (/) in the blank.
Example:
Television is rapidly becoming the literature of our periodsu. 1. time/times/period
Many of the arguments havingu used for the study of literature as 2. _______\_______
a school subject are valid for ∧ study of television. 3. ______the______
When you start talking about good and bad manners you immediately start meeting difficulties. Many people just cannot agree what they mean. We asked a lady, who replied that she thought you could tell a well-mannered person on the way they (71) occupied the space around them―for example, when such a person walks down a street he or she is constantly unaware of (72) others. Such people never bump into other people.
However, a second person thought that this was more a question of civilized behavior as good manners. Instead, this (73) other person told us a story, it he said was quite well known, (74) about an American who had been invited to an Arab meal at (75) one of the countries of the Middle East. The American hasn’t (76) been told very much about the kind of food he might expect. If he had known about American food, he might have behaved (77) better.
Immediately before him was a very flat piece of bread that looked, to him, very much as a napkin (餐巾） Picking it (78) up, he put it into his collar, so that it falls across his shirt. (79)
His Arab host, who had been watching, said of nothing, but (80) immediately copied the action of his guest.
And that, said this second person, was a fine example of good manners.

Is a Test of spoken English Necessary?
A test of spoken English will be included as an optional component of the College English Test (CET). We have all taken, and are thus familiar with, English tests of many kinds, but so far most of them are written ones. Have you any idea of what a spoken English test will be like, and is it necessary to go to all the trouble to hold or take such a test? People differ in their answers.
Many people will think it necessary. They know that although they have taken dozens, even hundreds, of English tests ever since they started learning it and many even have got surprisingly high marks, few of them can express themselves freely in spoken English, and if people can’t speak a word of it, what’s the sense of learning it and what do those high marks mean?―They’re none but deaf-and-mutes before the native speakers. Furthermore, with so many college graduates and undergraduates having mutes before the native speakers. Furthermore, with so many college graduates and undergraduates having passed CET4 and CET6, a test of spoken English is a further way to tell the excellent from the not so excellent. Finally, it is viewed as a new challenge to those who “live and learn”.
There are, however, also people who think differently. Besides the pains in preparation for such a new kind of test, there is also the uncertainty about the reliability and objectivity of the marking system, which may depend mainly on human (and thus subjective) scoring instead of on machine scoring, as in the case of a standardized objective test such as CET4 and CET6.
At the prospect of this optional test, I feel encouraged and regard it as a welcome challenge and another opportunity to improve my language ability and career potentials. I am determined to practice my oral English more often, and if I am qualified for such a test, I will not hesitate a moment to apply for it.

Part II Reading Comprehension
本文是一篇论述20世纪二、三十年代美国农业所面临的困境及美国政府采取的种种措施帮助农业摆脱困境的说明文，全文三段，第一段为背景辅垫: 美国农业面临的困境及其原因和对农民的灾难性后果；第二、三段为主体，美国政府振兴农业的措施，尤以第三段为重点，三十年代罗斯福总统执政后采取的通过立法手段恢复农业经济的两个阶段的措施，前一阶段通过AAA法案直接减少耕地面积，并给农民有偿补助；第二阶段在AAA被最高法院认定为违宪后通过一系列殊途同归的基于耕地保养原则的削减耕地、洪涝挽救措施。
21. 答案为B 本题属要点归纳题，问及引起美国农产品需求量走下坡路的原因，答案当在第一段第一句: 句中“as”即是这因果关系的关键词。A只是使这一现象加重的原因，C、D则明显与短文内容相悖。
22. 答案为C 要点定位理解题。根据题意，本题答案必须从第二段确定政府采取直接干预农业供求矛盾，原则以为农民提供更大的经济稳定性，也即预防农民破产。选项B属第三段内容，A和D明显有悖文章内容。
23. 答案为D 本题也属要点归纳题。答案在短文第三段第三、四句，选项B、C均属政府行为，而非鼓励农民自己运河做的事。D与短文要点相运河甚远，self-sufficient 只在第一段提到。
24. 答案为D 本题也属要点归纳题。根据题意，确定答案在第三段第五句(no the grounds that...)部分，再可结合该段倒数第二句，从另一角度论证答案D的合理性。A中scarcity of farm products 在上一句，不属本题要点范围，B、C明显不合理。
25. 答案为D 要点归纳定位题。根据new laws,可确定本题问题指向第三段第二个层次。归纳该层次要点再结合24题答案，即可明确答案为D.选项B虽也似乎正确，但与本文主题关系较疏远，故不选。
本文为一篇关于人工智能研究开发的说明文。第一段通过五十年代人工智能先驱们的预言与当今现实脱节这一事实提出人工智能研究开发所面临的问题，第二段前2句论及这一问题的症结: try to separate the most abstract levels of thought and duplicate them with logical programs.从第三句开始进入全文的核心: 崭新的人工智能研究设想: 把人工智能的研究与天然智能的进化、人脑生物细胞蛋白质、人脑的神经系统研究结合起来。第三段论述了电脑―生物物理学家Conrad对自己这方面研究的评论、发现、启示和设想。最后一段为对这一全新的人工智能研究开发方法的评论与总结，其中自然隐含着作者的观点与态度。
26. 答案为D 要点归纳题。根据题意确定答案在第一段第二、三句。注意选项A中“are capable of reliably recognizing...”与短文中“struggle to reliably recognize...”(努力、竭力、试图)是不一致的，故不能选；更多的考生可能会误选C, 但①在效能(performance)上，当天电脑与50年代的电脑相距是非常大的；②本文探讨的是人工智能，而非电脑的一般效能，故选题时要紧扣短文主题。
27. 答案为B 要点推论题。人工智能研究开发为什么会开辟一条全新的途径，一定是研究中碰到了难以逾越的障碍，这就是传统研究方法上的误区，也即第二段之第一、二句。
28. 答案为C 要点推论题。根据题意确定答案在第三段根据Conrad对自己研究的评述(says)，研究中的发现(examples)，假设(believe)与断言(claim)，可归纳推断他们是在天然智能如何发展这一方面的研究中做了巨大的努力。
29. 答案为B 作者观点态度推论题。如前所述，文章最后一段为作者对人工智能研究新方法的总结，其中隐含着作者的观点，另外短文第二段最后一句中“promising”、“surely”、第三段第一句中“a huge step in the right direction...”等都流露了作者的态度一作者对新的人工智能研究运动是非常肯定的。选项A中的“will soon die out”，C中的“like a game rather than”及D中“nobody is sure”等均含否定意念，不能作为答案。
30. 答案为D 词语理解题。阅读中词语的理解也不能脱离短文主题: game 一词有游戏、竞赛方法规则、策略、计谋、方针对行动步骤等多种释义，D是短语的简单改写，不可能作为答案，B重点在获奖也与短文内容相运河甚远，也应排除。容易混淆的是选项C, 只是C侧重研究领域，即范围，而本文主题讨论研究方法即途径。
本文为一篇论及(美国)私人轿车环境影响的说明文，第一段提出了问题的严惩性与迫切性―尤其对于美国；第二、三段论及决策者及汽车工业面临的四大选择及对它们可行性的评价，作者基本肯定了其中的第四个方案，即引入电气汽车(寻找污染较短的绿色驱动系统)。
31. 答案为B 要点归纳题―第一段落主题。选项A、C和D均仅涉及问题的某个方面，只有B代表了私人轿车继续增长的真正后果。
32. 答案为C 要点推论题。根据第一段最后一句“It is unlikely... that other nations will accept a large and growing U.S. contribution to global climatic change”，再结合上文论及轿车问题和“face... political cost”等细节，可推知答案。
33. 答案为C 要点定位题。根据题干中的“solution”可确定答案在第二段，又根据“best”可进一步确定答案在该段第二句“... is the only sustainable (可持续) option”。
34. 答案为B 要点正误判断题。要点判断各选项涉及内容可能在短文的任何地方，但正确答案通常仍应与主题一致。A之因果关系与短文内容(第二段倒数第二句)不一致；C与短文内容(第二段最后一句及第一、二句)相矛盾；D也非短文最后一句之本意。
本文是关于Reebok鞋业公司营销策略的一篇说明文。第一段概述(通过管理层之口)其公司产品的目标市场；第二段论及其对高档消费人群这一块零售市场的营销策略；第三段论及营销策略的另一方面―精选批发商；最后一段谈市场预测及营销决策。
36. 答案为A 要点推论题。题干中的“managerial personnel”即为第一段的executives, 因此可知本题答案在第一段且为该段之主题: 目标市为多大，高层领导们当然不希望自己的产品仅供应一些雅皮士，再由下文之“children’s shoes for the under-18 set and walking for older customers”更可知其目标消费是多高层次的。容易错选的选项B侧重公司的生产策略，故不妥。
37. 答案为D 句意理解及要点暗示题。题干引号中那部分在第二段，答案当然应在第二段，而该段主要论及高档消费群体的零售网―只在精品专卖屋、体育用品专卖店及大百货商场销售。
38. 答案为A 要点归纳题。根据题干中“limit the number of distributions”确定答案在第三段该段论及即使产品供不应求时，也要对批发商有所选择，而过运河一段时间对批发商数量的限制主要是“out of necessity”(迫不得已)，因为需求量出乎意料地超过了供应能力。
39. 答案为C 要点理解定位题。题干中的“although”与短文第三段倒数第二句之“but”相呼应，答案即为该句的复述。
40. 答案为D 要点推论题。Nike (耐克)一词确定答案位置在最后一段，市场预测与决策。Nike 公司正是由于当时错误地判断了健身鞋流行的强度而导致了老产品(running shoes)的积压而不得不打折销售一这是市场预测不准确所导致的。

78. as → like本题考点: 易淆介词as意为“作为”，like意为“象”，根据本行意思，这里当是: 摆在他(美国人)面前一大片很薄的面包，在他眼里看上去非常像一块餐巾。因此，他就把那块面包拿起，塞到衣领里，让它挂在衬衫前。
79. falls → fell本题考点: 时态，阐述见76题。本句意思为: 因此，他就把那块面包拿起，塞到衣领里，让它挂在衬衫前。
80. of → 删，本题考点: 动词句型。say后换something等复合代词时为及物动词，不用介词，本句中said nothing为与后面copied并列的两个主句谓语动词。

Passage One
The piano and violin are girls’ instruments. Drums and trumpets are for boys. According to psychologists Susan Onco and Michael Balton, children have very clear ideas about which musical instruments they should play. They find that despite the best efforts of teachers these ideas have changed very little over the past decade. They interviewed 153 children aged between 9 and 11 from schools in northwest England. They asked them to identify 4 musical instruments and then to say which they would like to play most and which they would least lie to play. They also asked the children for their views on whether boys or girls should not play any of the 4 instruments. The piano and the violin were both ranked more favorably by girls than by boys, while boys prefer the drums and trumpets. There was broad agreement between boys and girls on which instruments each sex should play and the reasons vary. And while almost half of all boys said they avoid certain instruments because they were too difficult to play, only 15% of girls gave that as a reason. Earlier studies indicated that very young school children aged between 5 and 7 showed no bias in choosing musical instruments, but their tastes become more clear between the ages of 8 and 10. One survey of 78 teachers suggested that after that age both boys and girls.
11. Why did Susan and Michael interview children aged between 9 and 11?
12. Why do many of the boys avoid certain instruments?
13. Which group of children have a bias when choosing musical instruments?
Passage Two
In the 1970s, the famous Brazilian football player Pele retired from the national team of Brazil and became a professional player for a team in New York. Football, or soccer, wasn’t very popular in the United States at that time. Few North Americans knew anything about this fast-moving sport. There was no money to pay professional players and there was little interest in football in high schools and colleges. When Pele and other international stars began playing in various US cities, people saw how interesting the game was and began to go to the matches. It is now common for important games to have fifty to sixty thousand fans. Support from the fans is important to the football. The fans cheer enthusiastically for their favorite players and teams, who respond by playing better than before. In most World Cups, the home team, or the team from the host country usually plays better than most people expect. In 1966, 1974 and 1978, the home teams of England, West Germany and Argentina all won the World Cup. The World Cup is called that because teams from every continent have played in it. However, since the Cup began, all of the winning teams have been from Europe or South America. Teams from Asia or Africa always do well but they haven’t yet won. Mexico played surprisingly well in the 1970 Cup, which it hosted, but it wasn’t among the 4 final teams.
14. Why wasn’t football a popular sport in the U.S. in the 1970s?
15. When does a football team have the best chance to win the World Cup?
16. How did Mexico do in the 1970 World Cup?
Passage Three
The world’s smartest adolescence in mathematics and science are in Singapore, according to a global survey of educational achievement. In the 3rd International Mathematics and Science Study, 13-year-olds from Singapore achieved the best scores in standardized tests of maths and science that were administered to 287,896 students in 41 countries in 1994 and 1995. The survey suggests that science and maths education is especially strong in the Far East. While well behind those top scores, students from Australia earned higher marks in maths than their counterparts in England, who in turn did better than American students. The study collected information on the students’ teachers and homes. Not surprisingly, the highest-scoring students had well-educated parents or came from homes containing study-aids such as computers, dictionaries or even such elemental facilities as desks. The study shows that boys generally did better than girls in science, but there was little difference between them in maths. Boys scored better than girls in physics and chemistry. There were no sex differences in the life and environmental sciences. In addition to being tested, students in the project were asked how proficient they thought they were in maths and science. Students in some countries, such as Columbia and Kuwait, had an overly optimistic view of their skills. Meanwhile, some of the best students from Japan and Korea for example were needlessly pessimistic even though they did far better in maths than almost all of other students.
17. Of the 4 groups of students, who scored the lowest in maths according to the survey?
18. What kind of students are most likely to become top scorers?
19. In what way do Columbian students differ from Japanese students?
20. In which subjects did boys score higher than girls?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.
Birds that are literally half asleep―with one brain hemisphere alert and the other sleeping―control which side of the brain remains awake, according to a new study of sleeping ducks.
Earlier studies have documented half brain sleep in a wide range of birds. The brain hemispheres take turns sinking into the sleep stage characterized by slow brain waves. The eye controlled by the sleeping hemisphere keeps shut, while the wakeful hemisphere’s eye stays open and alert. Birds also can sleep with both hemispheres resting at once.
Decades of studies of bird flocks led researchers to predict extra alertness in the more vulnerable, end of the row sleepers. Sure enough, the end birds tended to watch carefully on the side away from their companions. Ducks in the inner spots showed no preference for gaze direction.
Also, birds dozing (打盹) at the end of the line resorted to single hemisphere sleep, rather than total relaxation, more often than inner ducks did. Rotating 16 birds through the positions in a four duck row, the researchers found outer birds half asleep during some 32 percent of dozing time versus about 12 percent for birds in internal spots.
“We believe this is the first evidence for an animal behaviorally controlling sleep and wakefulness simultaneously in different regions of the brain,” the researchers say.
The results provide the best evidence for a long standing supposition that single hemisphere sleep evolved as creatures scanned for enemies. The preference for opening an eye on the lookout side could be widespread, he predicts. He’s seen it in a pair of birds dozing side by side in the zoo and in a single pet bird sleeping by a mirror. The mirror side eye closed as if the reflection were a companion and the other eye stayed open.
Useful as half sleeping might be, it’s only been found in birds and such water mammals (哺乳动物) as dolphins, whales, and seals. Perhaps keeping one side of the brain awake allows a sleeping animal to surface occasionally to avoid drowning.
Studies of birds may offer unique insights into sleep. Jerome M. Siegel of the UCLA says he wonders if birds’ half brain sleep “is just the tip of the iceberg (冰山)” He speculates that more examples may turn up when we take a closer look at other species.
11. A new study on birds’ sleep has revealed that ________.
A) half brain sleep is found in a wide variety of birds

Passage Two
Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.
A nine year old schoolgirl single handedly cooks up a science fair experiment that ends up debunking (揭穿…的真相) a widely practiced medical treatment. Emily Rosa’s target was a practice known as therapeutic (治疗的) touch (TT for short), whose advocates manipulate patients’ “energy fieldto make them feel better and even, say some, to cure them of various ills. Yet Emily’s test shows that these energy fields can’t be detected, even by trained TT practitioners (行医者). Obviously mindful of the publicity value of the situation, Journal editor George Lundberg appeared on TV to declare, “Age doesn’t matter. It’s good science that matters, and this is good science.”
Emily’s mother Linda Rosa, a registered nurse, has been campaigning against TT for nearly a decade. Linda first thought about TT in the late ‘80s, when she learned it was on the approved list for continuing nursing education in Colorado. Its 100,000 trained practitioners (48,000 in the U.S.) don’t even touch their patients. Instead, they waved their hands a few inches from the patient’s body, pushing energy fields around until they’re in “balance.” TT advocates say these manipulations can help heal wounds, relieve Pain and reduce fever. The claims are taken seriously enough that TT therapists are frequently hired by leading hospitals, at up to $70 an hour, to smooth patients’ energy, sometimes during surgery.
Yet Rosa could not find any evidence that it works. To provide such proof, TT therapists would have to sit down for independent testing―something they haven’t been eager to do, even though James Randi has offered more than $1 million to anyone who can demonstrate the existence of a human energy field. (He’s had one taker so far. She failed.) A skeptic might conclude that TT practitioners are afraid to lay their beliefs on the line. But who could turn down an innocent fourth grader? Says Emily: “I think they didn’t take me very seriously because I’m a kid.”
The experiment was straight forward: 21 TT therapists stuck their hands, palms up, through a screen. Emily held her own hand over one of theirs left or right and the practitioners had to say which hand it was. When the results were recorded, they’d done no better than they would have by simply guessing. If there was an energy field, they couldn’t feel it.
16. Which of the following is evidence that TT is widely practiced?
A) TT has been in existence for decades.
B) Many patients were cured by therapeutic touch.
C) TT therapists are often employed by leading hospitals.
D) More than 100,000 people are undergoing TT treatment.
17. Very few TT practitioners responded to the $1 million offer because ________.
A) they didn’t take the offer seriously
B) they didn’t want to risk their career
C) they were unwilling to reveal their secret
D) they thought it was not in line with their practice
18. The purpose of Emily Rosa’s experiment was ________.
A) to see why TT could work the way it did
B) to find out how TT cured patients’ illnesses
C) to test whether she could sense the human energy field
D) to test whether a human energy field really existed
19. Why did some TT practitioners agree to be the subjects of Emil’s experiment?
A) It involved nothing more than mere guessing.
B) They thought it was going to be a lot of fun.
C) It was more straightforward than other experiments.
D) They sensed no harm in a little girl’s experiment.
20. What can we learn from the passage?
A) Some widely accepted beliefs can be deceiving.
B) Solid evidence weighs more than pure theories.
C) Little children can be as clever as trained TT practitioners.
D) The principle of TT is too profound to understand.
Passage Three
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
What might driving on an automated highway be like? The answer depends on what kind of sys tem is ultimately adopted. Two distinct types are on the drawing board. The first is a special purpose lane system, in which certain lanes are reserved for automated vehicles. The second is a mixed traffic system: fully automated vehicles would share the road with partially automated or manual driven cars. A special purpose lane system would require more extensive physical modifications to existing highways, but it promises the greatest gains in freeway (高速公路) capacity.
Under either scheme, the driver would specify the desired destination, furnishing this information to a computer in the car at the beginning of the trip or perhaps just before reaching the automated highway. If a mixed traffic system way was in place, automated driving could begin whenever the driver was on suitably equipped roads. If special purpose lanes were available, the car could enter them and join existing traffic in two different ways. One method would use a special onramp (入口引道). As the driver approached the point of entry for the highway, devices installed on the roadside would electronically check the vehicle to determine its destination and to ascertain that it had the proper automation equipment in good working order. Assuming it passed such tests, the driver would then be guided through a gate and toward an automated lane. In this case, the transition from manual to auto mated control would take place on the entrance ramp. An alternative technique could employ conventional lanes, which would be shared by automated and regular vehicles. The driver would steer onto the highway and move in normal fashion to a “transition” lane. The vehicle would then shift under computer control onto a lane reserved for automated traffic. (The limitation of these lanes to automated traffic would, presumably, be well respected, because all trespassers (非法进入者) could be swiftly identified by authorities.)
Either approach to joining a lane of automated traffic would harmonize the movement of newly entering vehicles with those already traveling. Automatic control here should allow for smooth merging without the usual uncertainties and potential for accidents. And once a vehicle had settled into automated travel, the driver would be free to release the wheel, open the morning paper or just relax.
21. We learn from the first paragraph that two systems of automated highways ________.
A) are being planned
B) are being modified
C) are now in wide use
D) are under construction
22. A special purpose lane system is probably advantageous in that ________.
A) it would require only minor changes to existing highways
B) it would achieve the greatest highway traffic efficiency
C) it has a lane for both automated and partially automated vehicles
D) it offers more lanes for automated vehicles
23. Which of the following is true about driving on an automated highway?
A) Vehicles traveling on it are assigned different lanes according to their destinations.
B) A car can join existing traffic any time in a mixed lane system.
C) The driver should inform his car computer of his destination before driving onto it.
D) The driver should share the automated lane with those of regular vehicles.
24. We know from the passage that a car can enter a special purpose lane ________.
A) by smoothly merging with cars on the conventional lane
B) by way of a ramp with electronic control devices
C) through a specially guarded gate
D) after all trespassers are identified and removed
25. When driving in an automated lane, the driver ________.
A) should harmonize with newly entering cars
B) doesn’t have to rely on his computer system
C) should watch out for potential accidents
D) doesn’t have to hold on to the steering wheel
Passage Four
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Taking charge of yourself involves putting to rest some very prevalent myths. At the top of the list is the notion that intelligence is measured by your ability to solve complex problems; to read, write and compute at certain levels; and to resolve abstract equations quickly. This vision of intelligence asserts formal education and bookish excellence as the true measures of self fulfillment. It encourages a kind of intellectual prejudice that has brought with it some discouraging results. We have come to believe that someone who has more educational merit badges, who is very good at some form of school discipline is “intelligent.” Yet mental hospitals are filled with patients who have all of the properly lettered certificates. A truer indicator of intelligence is an effective, happy life lived each day and each present moment of every day.
If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it’s worth, then you are an intelligent person. Problem solving is a useful help to your happiness, but if you know that given your inability to resolve a particular concern you can still choose happiness for yourself, or at a minimum refuse to choose unhappiness, then you are intelligent. You are intelligent because you have the ultimate weapon against the big N.B.D.―Nervous Break Down.
“Intelligent people do not have N.B.D.’s because they are in charge of themselves. They know how to choose happiness over depression, because they know how to deal with the problems of their lives.
You can begin to think of yourself as truly intelligent on the basis of how you choose to feel in the face of trying circumstances. The life struggles are pretty much the same for each of us. Every one who is involved with other human beings in any social context has similar difficulties. Disagreements, conflicts and compromises are a part of what it means to be human. Similarly, money, growing old, sickness, deaths, natural disasters and accidents are all events which present problems to virtually all human beings. But some people are able to make it, to avoid immobilizing depression and unhappiness despite such occurrences, while others collapse or have an N.B.D. Those who recognize problems as a human condition and don’t measure happiness by an absence of problems are the most intelligent kind of humans we know; also, the most rare.
26. According to the author, the conventional notion of intelligence measured in terms of one’s ability to read, write and compute ________.
A) is a widely held but wrong concept
B) will help eliminate intellectual prejudice
C) is the root of all mental distress
D) will contribute to one’s self fulfillment
27. It is implied in the passage that holding a university degree ________.
A) may result in one’s inability to solve complex real life problems
B) does not indicate one’s ability to write properly worded documents
C) may make one mentally sick and physically weak
D) does not mean that one is highly intelligent
28. The author thinks that an intelligent person knows ________.
A) how to put up with some very prevalent myths
B) how to find the best way to achieve success in tire
C) how to avoid depression and make his life worthwhile
D) how to persuade others to compromise
29. In the last paragraph, the author tells us that ________.
A) difficulties are but part of everyone’s life
B) depression and unhappiness are unavoidable in life
C) everybody should learn to avoid trying circumstances
D) good feelings can contribute to eventual academic excellence
30. According to the passage, what kind of people are rare?
A) Those who don’t emphasize bookish excellence in their pursuit of happiness.
B) Those who are aware of difficulties in life but know how to avoid unhappiness.
C) Those who measure happiness by an absence of problems but seldom suffer from N.B.D’s.
D) Those who are able to secure happiness though having to struggle against trying circumstances.

答案详解
Part I Listening Comprehension
Part II Reading Comprehension
11. 正确答案为C)。根据文章第1、3-6段可知，对鸟类睡眠的最新研究表明，它们能够有意识地控制自己的半脑睡眠。这几段举例说明了对这个问题实验的情况。选项A)、B)、D)虽在文章第2 段中也提到了，但那是文献记载的以前研究的情况(Earlier studies have documented...)故均不是正确答案。
12. 正确答案为A)。根据文章第6段The results provide the best evidence for along standing supposition that single hemisphere sleep evolved as creatures scanned for enemies.(这些研究结果为一个长久以来的假设提供了最好的证据，即单侧脑睡眠是在生物警惕敌人过程中进化形成的。)
13. 正确答案为C)。根据文章第6段内容：鸟类单侧脑睡眠是在警惕敌人过程中进化而来，此结论还可推而广之。在需要警惕的一侧，鸟儿喜欢睁着一只眼睛…，一对动物园里的鸟儿挨着打瞌睡时 是如此，宠物鸟靠镜子一侧的眼睛闭着，好象镜子中的影子是一个伙伴，而另一只眼睛却睁着， 也说明这种情况。所以选项C)是答案。
14. 正确答案为B)。根据文章第7段第2句Perhaps keeping one side of the brain awake allows a sleeping animal to surface occasionally to avoid drowning.(也许，保持一侧脑醒着可以使睡眠中的动物不时浮出水面而刁；淹死。)所以B) emerge from water now and then to breathe (不时浮出水面来呼吸)是正确答案。
15. 正确答案为D)。根据文章最后的一段，也就是含有这个短语的上下文。Studies of birds may offer unique insights into sleep... He (Siegel) speculates that more examples may turn up when we take closer look at other species.(对鸟类的研究可能提供对睡眠的独特认识。...他推测当我们对其他物种仔细观察时，就会发现更多的例证。)因此选项D)所说“半侧脑睡眠这种现象可能存在于其他物种”正是“just the tip of iceberg”所表达的意思。
16. 正确答案为C)。根据第2段The claims are taken seriously enough that TT therapists are frequently hired by leading hospitals.(这种宣扬很受重视，以致TT行医者经常受雇于大的医院…)选项A)文章中没有提及，选项B)叙述不准确，文中只是说，据称这种方法能使人病情好转，甚至说有的能治疗各种疾病”。选项D)与文章内容不符，文章说，川万受过培训的TT行医者甚至不接触病人身体…。故A)，B)，D)均不是答案。
17. 正确答案为C)。根据文章第3段第2句：为了提供这样一个证明(证明人有“能场”)，TT行医者不得不坐下接受独立的测试―这是他们一直都不愿意做的事情，即使詹姆斯・兰迪为能演示人存在“能场”的人提供一百多万美元的奖金。 (To provide such proof, TT therapists would have to sit down for independent testing something they haven’t been eager to do, even though James Landi has offered more than $ 1 million to anyone who can demonstrate the existence of a human energy field.)
18. 正确答案为D)。根据文章第1段我们知道，TT行医者所宣扬的就是通过调节病人的“能场”来治病(whose advocates manipulate patient’s “energy field” to make them feel better and even, say some, to cure them of various ills)。在第2段中，又提到“运用这种手法可以推动能场转动直到平衡(... pushing energy fields around until they’re in “balance”)”而爱米丽・瑞莎的实验就是证明是否能场真的存在。特别文章最后一句If there was an energy field, they couldn’t feel it.(如果有一个能场的话，他们也感觉不到。)选项C)说是测试她能否感觉到能场，如果是这样的话，前提是存在一个能场，这当然是错误的。A)，B)两个选项也是错误的。
19. 正确答案为D)。根据文章第3段从第2句到段末这部分：A skeptic might conclude that TT practitioners are afraid to lay their beliefs on the line. But who would turn down an innocent, fourth grader? Says Emily: “I think they didn’t take me very seriously because I’m a kid”.(怀疑的人或许会因为TT行医者害怕使他们自己处于被揭露的危险中，但谁能拒绝一个天真的四年级的小学生呢?爱米丽说，“我想他们不会太把我当回事，因为我是个小孩子。”)
20. 正确答案为A)。此题要求概括主题。文章第1句就是主题句：A nine year old schoolgirl single-handly cooks up a science fair experiment the ends up debunking a widely practiced medical treatment. (一个9岁的小女孩独自设计了一个公开的科学实验，结果揭穿了一种广为流行的医疗方法的真相。)
21. 正确答案为A)。根据第1段第2，3句：The answer depends on what kind of system is ultimately adopted. Two distinct types are on the drawing board. (答案取决于最后采用哪一种系统，两种不同的类型都在绘图板上。)回答此问题的关键是要知道drawing board的意思。所以选项A) are being planned是正确答案。
22. 正确答案为B)。根据第1段最后一句：A special purpose lane system would require more extensive physical modifications to existing highways, but it promises the greatest gains in freeway capacity (特别目的车道系统要求对现有的高速公路进行更广泛的改造，但它会使高速公路获得最大的能力。)
23. 正确答案为C)。根据第2段第1句：Under either scheme, the driver would specify the desired destination, furnishing this information to a computer in the car at the beginning of the trip or perhaps just before reaching the automated highway.(不论采用那种设计，司机都需要在其开始行驶时或在到达自动化高速公路前确定要去的目的地，把这个信息输入车上的计算机。)故C)是正确答案。选项B)与文章内容相悖，因为原文第2段第2句是on suitably equipped roads而不是existing traffic.选项D)提到的情况只适用于第2种设计方案，即混合式交通系统。故A)，B)，D)均不是答案。
24. 正确答案为B)。根据文章第2段第3，4，5句：如果使用特殊目的的车道…一种方法是使用特殊的人口引道。当司机接近高速公路人口处时，安装在道边的电子装置会检测车辆的目的地并搞清是否有能工作的自动化装置。 (If special purpose lanes were available,... One method would use a special onramp. As drivers approached the point of entry for the highway, devices installed on the roadside would electronically check the vehicle to determine its destination and to ascertain that it had the proper automation equipment in good working order.)
25. 正确答案为D)。根据第3段的最后一句：And once a vehicle had settled into automated travel, the driver would be free to release the wheel, open the morning paper or just relax. (一旦车辆进入自动行驶状态，司机就可以放开方向盘，打开晨报或者只是休息。)
26. 正确答案为A)。这是一篇新老观点对应性文章。老观点也就是平常的大家普遍接受的观点：聪明指的是受到正规教育，成绩优秀，并以此作为自我完善的手段。新观点强调心理健康，否定老观点，所以A)是答案。
27. 正确答案为D)。通读全文我们知道，作者认为真正能体现聪明的是能否过一种有意义；愉快的生活，每天，每时都是这样。而获得大学学位的人未必能做到。所以选项D)与作者的这种观点相符，是正确答案。选项C)有一定的干扰性，虽然作者说神经病医院里满是持有各种证书的病人。但这并不是说持有大学学位可能使一个人神经得病或身体虚弱。
28. 正确答案为C)。选项A)与文章内容相悖，文章说要摒弃某些很流行的说法(putting rest some very prevalent myths)，而不是要忍耐这些说法。选项B)和选项D)的内容在文章中均未提到， 故只有选项C)是正确答案。另外，也可以根据第2段第1句来推断：If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it’s worth, then you are an intelligent person. (如果你感到愉快，如果你为所有值得的事物活每一时刻，你就是一个聪明的人。)
29. 正确答案为A)。根据第4段第2，3，4句的内容：在任何社会环境中与别人交往，每个人都有相的困难。意见不合，冲突和妥协是作为人的一部分存在的。 (Everyone who is involved with other human in any social context has similar difficulties. Disagreements, conflicts and compromises are a part of what it means to be human.)选项A)与之相符，是正确答案。选项B)干扰性较大，这与原文不符。原文说But some people are able to make it, to avoid immobilizing depression and unhappiness despite such occurrences.(但有些人能克服，尽管有这些事情发生，他们能避免陷入沮丧和不愉快中不能自拔。)这意味着生活中的沮丧和不愉快是可以避免的。
30. 正确答案为B)。根据第4段最后一句：Those who recognize problems as a human condition and don’t measure happiness by an absence of problems are the most intelligent kind of human we know, also the most rare. (那些认识到困难是人生必然存在的事物，不以有没有困难来衡量愉快，是我们所知最聪明的一类人，也是很罕见的人。)

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or finished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Our culture has caused most Americans to assume not only that our language is universal but that the gestures we use are understood by everyone. We do not realize that waving good-bye is the way to summon a person from the Philippines to one’s side, or that in Italy and some Latin-American countries, curling the finger to oneself is a sign of farewell.
Those private citizens who sent packages to our troops occupying Germany after World War II and marked them GIFT to escape duty payments did not bother to find out that “Gift” means poison in German. Moreover, we like to think of ourselves as friendly, yet we prefer to be at least 3 feet or an arm’s length away from others. Latins and Middle Easterners like to come closer and touch, which makes Americans uncomfortable.
Our linguistic (语言上的) and cultural blindness and the casualness with which we take notice of the developed tastes, gestures, customs and languages of other countries, are losing us friends, business and respect in the world.
Even here in the United States, we make few concessions to the needs of foreign visitors. There are no information signs in four languages on our public buildings or monuments; we do not have multilingual (多语言的) guided tours. Very few restaurant menus have translations, and multilingual waiters, bank clerks and policemen are rare. Our transportation systems have maps in English only and often we ourselves have difficulty understanding them.
When we go abroad, we tend to cluster in hotels and restaurants where English is spoken. Then attitudes and information we pick up are conditioned by those natives―usually the richer―who speak English. Our business dealings, as well as the nation’s diplomacy, are conducted through interpreters.
For many years, American dollars no longer buy all good things, and we are slowly beginning to realize that our proper role in the world is changing. A 1979 Harris poll reported that 55 percent of Americans want this country to play a more significant role in world affairs; we want to have a hand in the important decisions of the next century, even though it may not always he the upper hand.
21. It can be inferred that Americans being approached too closely by Middle Easterners would most probably ________.
A) stand still
B) jump aside
C) step forward
D) draw back
22. The author gives many examples to criticize Americans for their ________.
A) cultural self-centeredness
B) casual manners
C) indifference towards foreign visitors
D) arrogance towards other cultures
23. In countries other than their own most Americans ________.
A) are isolated by the local people
B) are not well informed due to the language barrier
C) tend to get along well with the natives
D) need interpreters in hotels and restaurants
24. According to the author, Americans’ cultural blindness and linguistic ignorance will ________.
A) affect their image in the new era
B) cut themselves off from the outside world
C) limit their role in world affairs
D) weaken the position of the US dollar
25. The author’s intention in writing this article is to make Americans realize that ________.
A) it is dangerous to ignore their foreign friends
B) it is important to maintain their leading role in world affairs
C) it is necessary to use several languages in public places
D) it is time to get acquainted with other cultures
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
In department stores and closets all over the world, they are waiting. Their outward appearance seems rather appealing because they come in a variety of styles, textures, and colors. But they are ultimately the biggest deception that exists in the fashion industry today. What are they? They are high heels―a woman’s worst enemy (whether she knows it or not). High heel shoes are the downfall of modern society. Fashion myths have led women to believe that they are more beautiful or sophisticated for wearing heels, but in reality, heels succeed in posing short as well as long term hardships. Women should fight the high heel industry by refusing to use or purchase them in order to save the world from unnecessary physical and psychological suffering.
For the sake of fairness, it must be noted that there is a positive side to high heels. First, heels are excellent for aerating (使通气) lawns. Anyone who has ever worn heels on grass knows what I am talking about. A simple trip around the yard in a pair of those babies eliminates all need to call for a lawn care specialist, and provides the perfect-sized holes to give any lawn oxygen without all those messy chunks of dirt lying around. Second, heels are quite functional for defense against oncoming enemies, who can easily be scared away by threatening them with a pair of these sharp, deadly fashion accessories.
Regardless of such practical uses for heels, the fact remains that wearing high heels is harmful to one’s physical health. Talk to any podiatrist (足病医生)， and you will hear that the majority of their business comes from high-heel-wearing women. High heels are known to cause problems such as deformed feet and torn toenails. The risk of severe back problems and twisted or broken ankles is three times higher for a flat shoe wearer. Wearing heels also creates the threat of getting a heel caught in a sidewalk crack or a sewer-grate (阴沟栅) and being thrown to the ground―possibly breaking a nose, back, or neck. And of course, after wearing heels for a day, any woman knows she can look forward to a night of pain as she tries to comfort her swollen, aching feet.
26. What makes women blind to the deceptive nature of high heels?
A) The multi-functional use of high heels.
B) Their attempt to show off their status.
C) The rich variety of high heel styles.
D) Their wish to improve their appearance.
27. The author’s presentation of the positive side of high heels is meant ________.
A) to be ironic
B) to poke fun at women
C) to be fair to the fashion industry
D) to make his point convincing
28. The author uses the expression “those babies” (Line 3, Para. 2) to refer to high heels ________.
A) to show their fragile characteristics
B) to indicate their feminine features
C) to show women’s affection for them
D) to emphasize their small size
29. The author’s chief argument against high heels is that ________.
A) they pose a threat to lawns
B) they are injurious to women’s health
C) they don’t necessarily make women beautiful
D) they are ineffective as a weapon of defense
30. It can be inferred from the passage that women should ________.
A) see through the very nature of fashion myths
B) boycott the products of the fashion industry
C) go to a podiatrist regularly for advice
D) avoid following fashion too closely
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
It is hardly necessary for me to cite all the evidence of the depressing state of literacy. These figures from the Department of Education are sufficient: 27 million Americans cannot read at all, and a further 35 million read at a level that is less than sufficient to survive in our society.
but my own worry today is less that of the overwhelming problem of elemental literacy than it is of the slightly more luxurious problem of the decline in the skill even of the middle-class reader, of his unwillingness to afford those spaces of silence, those luxuries of domesticity and time and concentration, that surround the image of the classic act of reading. It has been suggested that almost 80 percent of America’s literate, educated teenagers can no longer read without an accompanying noise (music) in the background or a television screen flickering (闪烁) at the corner of their field of perception. We know very little about the brain and how it deals with simultaneous conflicting input, but every common-sense intuition suggests we should be profoundly alarmed. This violation of concentration, silence, solitude (独处的状态) goes to the very heart of our notion of literacy; this new form of part-reading, of part-perception against background distraction, renders impossible certain essential acts of apprehension and concentration, let alone that most important tribute any human being can pay to a poem or a piece of prose he or she really loves, which is to learn it by heart. Not by brain, by heart; the expression is vital.
Under these circumstances, the question of what future there is for the arts of reading is a real one. Ahead of us lie technical, psychic (心理的), and social transformations probably much more dramatic than those brought about by Gutenberg, the German inventor in printing. The Gutenberg revolution, as we now know it, took a long time; its effects are still being debated. The information revolution will touch every fact of composition, publication, distribution, and reading. No one in the book industry can say with any confidence what will happen to the book as we’ve known it.
31. The picture of the reading ability of the American people, drawn by the author, is ________.
A) rather bleak
B) fairly bright
C) very impressive
D) quite encouraging
32. The author’s biggest concern is ________.
A) elementary school children’s disinterest in reading classics
B) the surprisingly low rate of literacy in the U.S.
C) the musical setting American readers require for reading
D) the reading ability and reading behavior of the middle class
33. A major problem with most adolescents who can read is ________.
A) their fondness of music and TV programs
B) their ignorance of various forms of art and literature
C) their lack of attentiveness and basic understanding
D) their inability to focus on conflicting input
34. The author claims that the best way a reader can show admiration for a piece of poetry or prose is ________.
A) to be able to appreciate it and memorize it
B) to analyze its essential features
C) to think it over conscientiously
D) to make a fair appraisal of its artistic value
35. About the future of the arts of reading the author feels ________.
A) upset
B) uncertain
C) alarmed
D) pessimistic
Passage Four
Questions 35 to 40 are based on the following passage.
For centuries, explorers have risked their lives venturing into the unknown for reasons that were to varying degrees economic and nationalistic. Columbus went west to look for better trade routes to the Orient and to promote the greater glory of Spain. Lewis and Clark journeyed into the American wilderness to find out what the U.S. had acquired when it purchased Louisiana, and the Apollo astronauts rocketed to the moon in a dramatic show of technological muscle during the cold war.
Although their missions blended commercial and political-military imperatives, the explorers involved all accomplished some significant science simply by going where no scientists had gone before.
Today Mars looms（隐约出现）as humanity’s next great terra incognita（未探明之地）. And with doubtful prospects for a short-term financial return, with the cold war a rapidly fading memory and amid a growing emphasis on international cooperation in large space ventures, it is clear that imperatives other than profits or nationalism will have to compel human beings to leave their tracks on the planet’s reddish surface. Could it be that science, which has long played a minor role in exploration, is at last destined to take a leading role? The question naturally invites a couple of others: Are there experiments that only humans could do on Mars? Could those experiments provide insights profound enough to justify the expense of sending people across interplanetary space?
With Mars the scientific stakes are arguably higher than they have ever been. The issue of whether life ever existed on the planet, and whether it persists to this day, has been highlighted by mounting evidence that the Red Planet once had abundant stable, liquid water and by the continuing controversy over suggestions that bacterial fossils rode to Earth on a meteorite（陨石）from valuable data about the range of conditions under which a planet can generate the complex chemistry that leads to life. If it could be established that life arose independently on Mars and Earth, the finding would provide the first concrete clues in one of the deepest mysteries in all of science: the prevalence of life in the universe.
36. According to the passage, the chief purpose of explorers in going to unknown places in the past was ________.
A) to display their country’s military might
B) to accomplish some significant science
C) to find new areas for colonization
D) to pursue commercial and state interests
37. At present, a probable inducement for countries to initiate large-scale space ventures is ________.
A) international cooperation
B) scientific research
C) nationalistic reasons
D) long-term pro fits
38. What is the main goal of sending human missions to Mars?
A) To find out if life ever existed there.
B) To see if humans could survive there.
C) To prove the feasibility of large-scale space ventures.
D) To show the leading role of science in space exploration.
39. By saying “With Mars the scientific stakes are arguably higher than they have ever been” (Line 1, Para. 4), the author means that ________.
A) with Mars the risks involved are much greater than any previous space ventures
B) in the case of Mars, the rewards of scientific exploration can be very high
C) in the case of Mars, much more research funds are needed than ever before
D) with Mars, scientists argue, the fundamental interests of science are at issue
40. The passage tells us that proof of life on Mars would ________.
A) make clear the complex chemistry in the development of life
B) confirm the suggestion that bacterial fossils traveled to Earth on a meteorite
C) reveal the kind of conditions under which life originates
D) provide an explanation why life is common in the universe

More people of tuberculosis (结核病)than of any other disease caused by a single agent. This has probably been the case in quite a white. During the early stages of the industrial revolution, perhaps one in every seventh deaths is Europe’s crowded cities were caused by the disease. From now on, though, western eyes, missing the global picture, saw the trouble going into decline. With occasional breaks for war, the rates of death and infection in the Europe and America dropped steadily through the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1950s, the introduction of antibiotics(抗菌素)strengthened the trend in rich countries, and the antibiotics were allowed to be imported to poor countries. Medical researchers declared victory and withdrew.
They are wrong. In the mid-1980s the frequency of infections and deaths started to pick up again around the world. Where tuberculosis vanished, it came back; in many places where it had never been away, it grew better. The World Heath Organization estimates that 1. 7 billion people (a third of the earth’s population) suffer from tuberculosis. Even the infection rate was falling, population growth kept the number of clinical cases more or less constantly at 8 million a year. Around 3 million of those people died, nearly all of them in poor countries.

Passage one
Last August, Susan and 42 other students got wet and dirty while removing six tons of garbage from the river running across their city. They cleaned up the river as part of a week-long environmental camp. Like one in three American rivers, this river is so polluted that it’s unsafe for swimming and fishing, still, Susan, who has just completed her third summer on the river clean-up, scene has changed in this river. “Since we started three years ago, the river is getting a lot cleaner”, she says. Environmental scientists praised the teenagers for removing garbage that can harm wild life. Waterbirds, for example, can choke on plastic bottle rings and get cut by scrap metal. Three years ago, when the clean-up started, garbage was everywhere, but this year, the teenagers had to hunt for garbage. They turn the clean-up into a competition to see who could find the most garbage and unload their boats fastest. By the end of the six hour shift, they have removed enough garbage to fill more than two large trucks. “Seeing all their garbage in the river makes people begin to care about environmental issues,” Susan says. She hopes that when others read that she and her peers care enough to clean it up, maybe they will think twice before they throw garbage in the river.
Questions 11-13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11. What does the passage tell us about American rivers?
12. What did the students find when they came to the river this year?
13. What is the expected reaction of the local people to the students’ efforts?
Passage Two
Why do we cry? Can you imagine life without tears? Not only do tears keep your eyes lubricated, they also contain a substance that kills certain bacteria so they can’t infect your eyes. Give up your tears, and you’ll lose this on-the-spot defense. Nobody wants to give up the flood of extra tears you produce when you get something physical or chemical in your eyes. Tears are very good at washing this irritating stuff out. Another thing you couldn’t do without your tears is cry from joy, anger or sadness. Humans are the only animals that produce tears in response to emotions, and most people say a good cry makes them feel better. Many scientists, therefore, believe that crying somehow helps us cope with emotional situations. Tear researcher, Winifred, is trying to figure out how it happens. One possibility he says is that tears discharge certain chemicals from your body, chemicals that build up during stress. When people talk about crying it out, “I think that might actually be what they are doing”, he says. If Fred is right, what do you think will happen to people who restrain their tears? Boys, for example, cry only about a quarter as often as girls once they reach teenage years, and we all cry a lot less now than we did as babies. Could it possibly be that we face less stress? Maybe we found another ways to deal with it, or maybe we just feel embarrassed.
Questions 14-17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14. What’s the topic discussed in this passage?
15. What is Winifred trying to find out?
16. What does the passage say about teenage boys and girls?
17. What’s the difference between human beings and other animals when shedding tears?
Passage three
Imaging this: you wake up each morning to find your sister lying beside you, to get dressed and tie your shoes, you use one hand and she uses another. You do everything out together, too, even sitting on the same chair at lunch and riding on the same bicycle. That’s what life is like for six-year-old Betty and Abby. Like most twins, the two girls look very much alike, but unlike most twins, Betty and Abby share parts of the same body. Twins like Betty and Abby are rare. Only about 40 sets are born in the United States each year. Few survive as long as Betty and Abby. That’s because twins often share vital organs, like a heart or brain. The shared organs are often badly shaped and may not be strong enough to support both twins. But Betty and Abby each has her own head, heart and stomach which function normally. Because she has three or four lungs which provide plenty of oxygen for both twins. Most of their completely shared organs lie below the waist. Betty And Abby live relatively normal lives. They attend a regular school, and each does her own school work. They prefer to do some projects together, though, for example, to cut out paper dolls, one twin holds the paper, while the other uses the scissors. But sometimes, the girls don’t want to do the same thing, for example, sometimes they want to play with different toys. What do they do then? “We toss a coin”, says Abby.
Questions 18-20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18. In what aspect, do Betty and Abby differ from most twins?
19. What does the passage tell us about twins who share parts of the same body?
20. What does the passage say about the education of the twin girls?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Navigation computers, now sold by most car-makers, cost $2,000 and up. No surprise, then, that they are most often found in luxury cars, like Lexus, BMW and Audi. But it is a developing technology―meaning prices should eventually drop―and the market does seem to be growing.
Even at current prices, a navigation computer is impressive. It can guide you from point to point in most major cities with precise turn-by-turn directions―spoken by a clear human-sounding voice, and written on a screen in front of the driver.
The computer works with an antenna (天线) that takes signals from no fewer than three of the 24 global positioning system (GPS) satellites. By measuring the time required for a signal to travel between the satellites and the antenna, the car’s location can be pinned down within 100 meters.
The satellite signals, along with inputs on speed from a wheel-speed sensor and direction from a meter, determine the car’s position even as it moves. This information is combined with a map database. Streets, landmarks and points of interest are included.
Most systems are basically identical. The differences come in hardware―the way the computer accepts the driver’s request for directions and the way it presents the driving instructions. On most systems, a driver enters a desired address, motorway junction or point of interest via a touch screen or disc. But the Lexus screen goes a step further: you can point to any spot on the map screen and get directions to it.
BMW’s system offers a set of cross hairs (瞄准器上的十字纹) that can be moved across the map (you have several choices of map scale) to pick a point you’d like to get to. Audi’s screen can be switched to TV reception.
Even the voices that recite the directions can differ, with better systems like BMW’s and Lexus’s having a wider vocabulary. The instructions are available in French, German, Spanish, Dutch and Italian, as well as English. The driver can also choose parameters for determining the route: fastest, shortest or no freeways (高速公路), for example.
21. We learn from the passage that navigation computers ________.
A) will greatly promote sales of automobiles
B) may help solve potential traffic problems
C) are likely to be accepted by more drivers

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
“The world’s environment is surprisingly healthy. Discuss.” If that were an examination topic, most students would tear it apart, offering a long list of complaints: from local smog (烟雾) to global climate change, from the felling (砍伐) of forests to the extinction of species. The list would largely be accurate, the concern legitimate. Yet the students who should be given the highest marks would actually be those who agreed with the statement. The surprise is how good things are, not how bad.
After all, the world’s population has more than tripled during this century, and world output has risen hugely, so you would expect the earth itself to have been affected. Indeed, if people lived, consumed and produced things in the same way as they did in 1900 (or 1950, or indeed 1980), the world by now would be a pretty disgusting place: smelly, dirty, toxic and dangerous.
But they don’t. The reasons why they don’t, and why the environment has not been mined, have to do with prices, technological innovation, social change and government regulation in response to popular pressure. That is why, today’s environmental problems in the poor countries ought, in principle, to be solvable.
Raw materials have not run out, and show no sign of doing so. Logically, one day they must: the planet is a finite place. Yet it is also very big, and man is very ingenious. What has happened is that every time a material seems to be running short, the price has risen and, in response, people have looked for new sources of supply, tried to find ways to use less of the material, or looked for a new substitute. For this reason prices for energy and for minerals have fallen in real terms during the century. The same is true for food. Prices fluctuate, in response to harvests, natural disasters and political instability; and when they rise, it takes some time before new sources of supply become available. But they always do, assisted by new farming and crop technology. The long term trend has been downwards.
It is where prices and markets do not operate properly that this benign (良性的) trend begins to stumble, and the genuine problems arise. Markets cannot always keep the environment healthy. If no one owns the resource concerned, no one has an interest in conserving it or fostering it: fish is the best example of this.
26. According to the author, most students ________.
A) believe the world’s environment is in an undesirable condition
B) agree that the environment of the world is not as bad as it is thought to be
C) get high marks for their good knowledge of the world’s environment
D) appear somewhat unconcerned about the state of the world’s environment
27. The huge increase in world production and population ________.
A) has made the world a worse place to live in
B) has had a positive influence on the environment
C) has not significantly affected the environment
D) has made the world a dangerous place to live in
28. One of the reasons why the long-term trend of prices has been downwards is that ________.
A) technological innovation can promote social stability
B) political instability will cause consumption to drop
C) new farming and crop technology can lead to overproduction
D) new sources are always becoming available
29. Fish resources are diminishing because ________.
A) no new substitutes can be found in large quantities
B) they are not owned by any particular entity
C) improper methods of fishing have mined the fishing grounds
D) water pollution is extremely serious
30. The primary solution to environmental problems is ________.
A) to allow market forces to operate properly
B) to curb consumption of natural resources
C) to limit the growth of the world population
D) to avoid fluctuations in prices
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
About the time that schools and others quite reasonably became interested in seeing to it that all children, whatever their background, were fairly treated, intelligence testing became unpopular.
Some thought it was unfair to minority children. Through the past few decades such testing has gone out of fashion and many communities have indeed forbidden it.
However, paradoxically, just recently a group of black parents filed a lawsuit (诉讼) in California claiming that the state’s ban on IQ testing discriminates against their children by denying them the opportunity to take the test. (They believed, correctly, that IQ tests are a valid method of evaluating children for special education classes.) The judge, therefore, reversed, at least partially, his original decision.
And so the argument goes on and on. Does it benefit or harm children from minority groups to have their intelligence tested? We have always been on the side of permitting, even facilitating, such testing. If a child of any color or group is doing poorly in school it seems to us very important to know whether it is because he or she is of low intelligence, or whether some other factor is the cause.
What school and family can do to improve poor performance is influenced by its cause. It is not discriminative to evaluate either a child’s physical condition or his intellectual level.
Unfortunately, intellectual level seems to be a sensitive subject, and what the law allows us to do varies from time to time. The same fluctuation back and forth occurs in areas other than intelligence. Thirty years or so ago, for instance, white families were encouraged to adopt black children. It was considered discriminative not to do so.
And then the style changed and this cross-racial adopting became generally unpopular, and social agencies felt that black children should go to black families only. It is hard to say what are the best procedures. But surely good will on the part of all of us is needed.
As to intelligence, in our opinion, the more we know about any child’s intellectual level, the better for the child in question.
31. Why did the intelligence test become unpopular in the past few decades?
A) Its validity was challenged by many communities.
B) It was considered discriminative against minority children.
C) It met with strong opposition from the majority of black parents.
D) It deprived the black children of their rights to a good education.
32. The recent legal action taken by some black parents in California aimed to ________.
A) draw public attention to IQ testing
B) put an end to special education
C) remove the state’s ban on intelligence tests
D) have their children enter white schools
33. The author believes that intelligence testing ________.
A) may ease racial confrontation in the United States
B) can encourage black children to keep up with white children
C) may seriously aggravate racial discrimination in the United States
D) can help black parents make decisions about their children’s education
34. The author’s opinion of child adoption seems to be that ________.
A) no rules whatsoever can be prescribed
B) white families should adopt black children
C) adoption should be based on IQ test results
D) cross-racial adoption is to be advocated
35. Child adoption is mentioned in the passage to show that ________.
A) good will may sometimes complicate racial problems
B) social surroundings are vital to the healthy growth of children
C) intelligence testing also applies to non-academic areas
D) American opinion can shift when it comes to sensitive issues
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Not too many decades ago it seemed “obvious” both to the general public and to sociologists that modern society has changed people’s natural relations, loosened their responsibilities to kin (亲戚) and neighbors, and substituted in their place superficial relationships with passing acquaintances. However, in recent years a growing body of research has revealed that the “obvious” is not true. It seems that if you are a city resident, you typically know a smaller proportion of your neighbors than you do if you are a resident of a smaller community. But, for the most part, this fact has few significant consequences. It does not necessarily follow that if you know few of your neighbors you will know no one else.
Even in very large cities, people maintain close social ties within small, private social worlds. Indeed, the number and quality of meaningful relationships do not differ between more and less urban people. Small-town residents are more involved with kin than are big-city residents. Yet city dwellers compensate by developing friendships with people who share similar interests and activities. Urbanism may produce a different style of life, but the quality of life does not differ between town and city. Nor are residents of large communities any likelier to display psychological symptoms of stress or alienation, a feeling of not belonging, than are residents of smaller communities. However, city dwellers do worry more about crime, and this leads them to a distrust of strangers.
These findings do not imply that urbanism makes little or no difference. If neighbors are strangers to one another, they are less likely to sweep the sidewalk of an elderly couple living next door or keep an eye out for young trouble makers. Moreover, as Wirth suggested, there may be a link between a community’s population size and its social heterogeneity (多样性). For instance, sociologists have found much evidence that the size of a community is associated with bad behavior including gambling, drugs, etc. Large-city urbanites are also more likely than their small-town counterparts to have a cosmopolitan (见多识广者的) outlook, to display less responsibility to traditional kinship roles, to vote for leftist political candidates, and to be tolerant of nontraditional religious groups, unpopular political groups, and so-called undesirables. Everything considered, heterogeneity and unusual behavior seem to be outcomes of large population size.
36. Which of the following statements best describes the organization of the first paragraph?
A) Two contrasting views are presented.
B) An argument is examined and possible solutions given.
C) Research results concerning the quality of urban life are presented in order of time.
D) A detailed description of the difference between urban and small-town life is given.
37. According to the passage, it was once a common belief that urban residents ________.
A) did not have the same interests as their neighbors
B) could not develop long-standing relationships
C) tended to be associated with bad behavior
D) usually had more friends
38. One of the consequences of urban life is that impersonal relationships among neighbors ________.
A) disrupt people’s natural relations
B) make them worry about crime
C) cause them not to show concern for one another
D) cause them to be suspicious of each other
39. It can be inferred from the passage that the bigger a community is, ________.
A) the better its quality of life
B) the more similar its interests
C) the more tolerant and open-minded it is
D) the likelier it is to display psychological symptoms of stress
40. What is the passage mainly about?

B) Advantages of living in big cities as compared with living in small towns.
C) The positive role that urbanism plays in modern life.

Sporting activities are essentially modified forms of hunting behavior. Viewing biologically, the modern (S1) footballer is revealed as a member of a disguised hunting pack. His killing weapon has turned into a harmless football and his prey into a goal-mouth. If his aim is inaccurate and he (S2) scores a goal, enjoys the hunter’s triumph of killing his prey. (S3)
To understand how this transformation has taken place we must briefly look up at our ancient ancestors. They spent over a (S4) million year evolving as co-operative hunters. Their very survival (S5) depended on success in the hunting-field. Under this pressure their whole way of life, even if their bodies, became radically (S6) changed. They became chasers, runners, jumpers, aimers, throwers and prey-killers. They co-operate as skillful male-group (S7) attackers.
Then, about ten thousand years ago, when this immensely (S8) long formative period of hunting for food, they became farmers.
Their improved intelligence, so vital to their old hunting life, were put to a new use-that of penning ( 把 ...... 关在圈中), (S9) controlling and domesticating their prey. The food was there on the farms, awaiting their needs. The risks and uncertainties of farming were no longer essential for survival. (S10)

Passage 1
Nilrikman and others of the halfway research group have done some research into the differences between average and good negotiators. They found negotiators with the good trait record and studied them in action. They compared them with another group of average negotiators and found that there was no difference in the time that the two groups spent on planning their strategy. However, there were some significant differences on other points. The average negotiators thought in terms of the present, but the good negotiators took a long-time review. They made lots of suggestions and considered twice the number of the alternatives. The average negotiators set their objectives as single points. We hope to get two dollars, for example. The good negotiators set their objectives in terms of range, which they might formulate as “We hope to get two dollars, but if we get one dollar and fifty, it will be all right.”. The average negotiators tried to persuade by giving lots of reasons. They use a lot of different arguments. The good negotiators didn’t give many reasons. They just repeated the same ones. They also did more summarizing and reviewing, checking they were understood correctly.
11. What do good negotiators and average negotiators have in common?
12. According to the speaker, what would good negotiators do?
13. According to the speaker, what does the average negotiator usually do?
Passage 2
To most of us sharks are the most dangerous fish in the sea and they attack humans. However, according to Doctor Clark, who has studied the behavior of sharks for twelve years, humans are not normally on the shark’s menu. What do sharks feed on, mainly fish and other sea animals? Doctor Clark also found that sharks don’t eat as much food as people think. For instance, a nine-year-old shark only needs two pound of food a day to keep healthy. But she says, sharks sometimes starve and at other times they fill themselves with what they have killed. Around the world, there are only about one hundred shark attacks on humans each year, ten of which proved fatal. But consider this, in the US alone, about three million people are bitten by dogs each year. Of these, thirty people die. If sharks bite you, says Doctor Clark, the reason is usually because it mistakes you for natural food. For example, say you went underwater-fishing and saw a shark, you could be in trouble. The shark might go for the injured fish you had attacked and take a bite of you at the same time. If you go into a shark’s territory and threaten it, it might try to bite you. That’s because sharks are territorial and tend to guard their territory. Like dogs, they protect the area they think is their own.
14. What does the passage say about the eating behavior of sharks?
15. When might a shark attach humans?
16. What do we learn from the passage about sharks?
Passage 3
Science fiction writers have often imagined humans going to live on the Mars. But these days, scientists are taking the idea seriously. It has a great deal to recommend it, since it might solve the problem of overcrowding on the earth. But obviously, it would not be worth making the effort unless people could live there naturally. If the atmosphere were like that of the earth, this might be possible. But in fact it is mostly carbon dioxide. Apart from that, there are other problems to be overcome. For example, the temperature would have to be raised from 6 degrees below zero to 15 degrees above it. Scientists who study Mars have laid down the program that they can follow. To begin with, they will have to find out whether life has ever existed on the planet of Mars in the past. Secondly they will have to make a reliable map of its surface. And finally, they will have to make a list of the gases. Above all, they will have to discover how much nitrogen it possesses. Since nitrogen is four fifths of the air we breathe, they are surprising optimistic about raising the temperature on Mars and believe it could be down in hundred years. It will take a bit longer, though, to transform the atmosphere so that human beings could live there. Scientists estimate this will take one hundred thousand years.
17. Why are scientists interested in Mars?
18. What is the one of the things that must be done if a man can live on Mars?
19. Why do scientist want to find out whether there is sufficient nitrogen on Mars?
20. What is the prospect of people living on Mars?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
When global warming finally came, it stuck with a vengeance (异乎寻常地). In some regions, temperatures rose several degrees in less than a century. Sea levels shot up nearly 400 feet, flooding coastal settlements and forcing people to migrate inland. Deserts spread throughout the world as vegetation shifted drastically in North America, Europe and Asia. After driving many of the animals around them to near extinction, people were forced to abandon their old way of life for a radically new survival strategy that resulted in widespread starvation and disease. The adaptation was farming: the global-warming crisis that gave rise to it happened more than 10,000 years ago.
As environmentalists convene in Rio de Janeiro this week to ponder the global climate of the future, earth scientists are in the midst of a revolution in understanding how climate has changed in the past―and how those changes have transformed human existence. Researchers have begun to piece together an illuminating picture of the powerful geological and astronomical forces that have combined to change the planet’s environment from hot to cold, wet to dry and back again over a time period stretching back hundreds of millions of years.
Most importantly, scientists are beginning to realize that the climatic changes have had a major impact on the evolution of the human species. New research now suggests that climate shifts have played a key role in nearly every significant turning point in human evolution: from the dawn of primates (灵长目动物) some 65 million years ago to human ancestors rising up to walk on two legs, from the huge expansion of the human brain to the rise of agriculture. Indeed, the human history has not been merely touched by global climate change, some scientists argue, it has in some instances been driven by it.
The new research has profound implications for the environmental summit in Rio. Among other things, the findings demonstrate that dramatic climate change is nothing new for planet Earth. The benign (宜人的) global environment that has existed over the past 10,000 years―during which agriculture, writing, cities and most other features of civilization appeared―is a mere bright spot in a much larger pattern of widely varying climate over the ages. In fact, the pattern of climate change in the past reveals that Earth’s climate will almost certainly go through dramatic changes in the future―even without the influence of human activity.
21. Farming emerged as a survival strategy because man had been obliged ________.
A) to give up his former way of life
B) to leave the coastal areas
C) to follow the ever-shifting vegetation
D) to abandon his original settlement
22. Earth scientists have come to understand that climate ________.
A) is going through a fundamental change
B) has been getting warmer for 10,000 years
C) will eventually change from hot to cold
D) has gone through periodical changes
23. Scientists believe that human evolution ________.
A) has seldom been accompanied by climatic changes
B) has exerted little influence on climatic changes
C) has largely been effected by climatic changes
D) has had a major impact on climatic changes
24. Evidence of past climatic changes indicates that ________.
A) human activities have accelerated changes of Earth’s environment
B) Earth’s environment will remain mild despite human interference
C) Earth’s climate is bound to change significantly in the future
D) Earth’s climate is unlikely to undergo substantial changes in the future
25. The message the author wishes to convey in the passage is that ________.
A) human civilization remains glorious though it is affected by climatic changes
B) mankind is virtually helpless in the face of the dramatic changes of climate
C) man has to limit his activities to slow down the global warming process
D) human civilization will continue to develop in spite of the changes of nature
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Now woman can be too rich or too thin. This saying often attributed to the late Duchess (公爵夫人) of Windsor embodies much of the odd spirit of our times. Being thin is deemed as such a virtue.
The problem with such a view is that some people actually attempt to live by it. I myself have fantasies of slipping into narrow designer clothes. Consequently, I have been on a diet for the better―or worse―part of my life. Being rich wouldn’t be bad either, but that won’t happen unless an unknown relative dies suddenly in some distant land, leaving me millions of dollars.
Where did we go off the track? When did eating butter become a sin, and a little bit of extra flesh unappealing, if not repellent? All religions have certain days when people refrain from eating, and excessive eating is one of Christianity’s seven deadly sins. However, until quite recently, most people had a problem getting enough to eat. In some religious groups, wealth was a symbol of probable salvation and high morals, and fatness a sign of wealth and well-being.
Today the opposite is true. We have shifted to thinness as our new mark of virtue. The result is that being fat―or even only somewhat overweight―is bad because it implies a lack of moral strength.
Our obsession (迷恋) with thinness is also fueled by health concerns. It is true that in this country we have more overweight people than ever before, and that, in many cases, being overweight correlates with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. These diseases, however, may have as much to do with our way of life and our high-fat diets as with excess weight. And the associated risk of cancer in the digestive system may be more of a dietary problem―too much fat and a lack of fiber―than a weight problem.
The real concern, then, is not that we weigh too much, but that we neither exercise enough nor eat well. Exercise is necessary for strong bones and both heart and lung health. A balanced diet without a lot of fat can also help the body avoid many diseases. We should surely stop paying so much attention to weight. Simply being thin is not enough. It is actually hazardous if those who get (or already are) thin think they are automatically healthy and thus free from paying attention to their overall life-style. Thinness can be pure vainglory (虚荣).
26. In the eyes of the author, an odd phenomenon nowadays is that ________.
A) the Duchess of Windsor is regarded as a woman of virtue
B) looking slim is a symbol of having a large fortune
C) being thin is viewed as a much desired quality
D) religious people are not necessarily virtuous
27. Swept by the prevailing trend, the author ________.
A) had to go on a diet for the greater part of her life
B) could still prevent herself from going off the track
C) had to seek help from rich distant relatives
D) had to wear highly fashionable clothes
28. In human history, people’s views on body weight ________.
A) were closely related to their religious beliefs
B) changed from time to time
C) varied between the poor and the rich
D) led to different moral standards
29. The author criticizes women’s obsession with thinness ________.
A) from an economic and educational perspective
B) from sociological and medical points of view
C) from a historical and religious standpoint
D) in the light of moral principles
30. What’s the author’s advice to women who are absorbed in the idea of thinness?
A) They should be more concerned with their overall lifestyle.
B) They should be more watchful for fatal diseases.
C) They should gain weight to look healthy.
D) They should rid themselves of fantasies about designer clothes.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
War may be a natural expression of biological instincts and drives toward aggression in the human species. Natural impulses of anger, hostility, and territoriality (守卫地盘的天性) are expressed through acts of violence. These are all qualities that humans share with animals. Aggression is a kind of innate (天生的) survival mechanism, an instinct for self-preservation that allows animals to defend themselves from threats to their existences of human violence are always conditioned by social conventions that give shape to aggressive behavior. In human societies violence has a social function. It is a strategy for creating or destroying forms of social order. Religious traditions have taken a leading role in directing the powers of violence. We will look at the ritual and ethical (道德上的) patterns within which human violence has been directed.
The violence within a society is controlled through institutions of law. The more developed a legal system becomes, the more society takes responsibility for the discovery, control, and punishment of violent acts. In most tribal societies the only means to deal with an act of violence is revenge. Each family group may have the responsibility for personally carrying out judgment and punishment upon the person who committed the offense. But in legal systems, the responsibility for revenge becomes depersonalized and diffused. The society assumes the responsibility for protecting individuals from violence. In cases where they cannot be protected, the society is responsible for imposing punishment. In a state controlled legal system, individuals are removed from the cycle of revenge motivated by acts of violence, and the state assumes responsibility for their protection.
The other side of a state legal apparatus is a state military apparatus. While the one protects the individual from violence, the other sacrifices the individual to violence in the interests of the state. In war the state affirms its supreme power over the individuals within its own borders. War is not simply a trial by combating to settle disputes between states; it is the moment when the state makes its most powerful demands upon its people for their commitment allegiance, and supreme sacrifice. Times of war test a community’s deepest religious and ethical commitments.
31. Human violence shows evidence of being a learned behavior in that ________.
A) it threatens the existing social systems
B) it is influenced by society
C) it has roots in religious conflicts
D) it is directed against institutions of law
32. The function of legal systems, according to the passage, is ________.
A) to control violence within a society
B) to protect the world from chaos
C) to free society from the idea of revenge
D) to give the government absolute power
33. What does the author mean by saying “... in legal systems, the responsibility for revenge becomes depersonalized and diffused” (Lines 4-5, Para. 2)?
A) Legal systems greatly reduce the possibilities of physical violence.
B) Offenses against individuals are no longer judged on a personal basis.
C) Victims of violence find it more difficult to take revenge.
D) Punishment is not carried out directly by the individuals involved.
34. The word “allegiance” (Line 4, Para. 3) is closest in meaning to ________.
A) loyalty
B) objective
C) survival
D) motive
35. What can we learn from the last paragraph?
A) Governments tend to abuse their supreme power in times of war.
B) In times of war governments may extend their power across national borders.
C) In times of war governments impose high religious and ethical standards on their people.
D) Governments may sacrifice individuals in the interests of the state in times of war.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Researchers who are unfamiliar with the cultural and ethnic groups they are studying must take extra precautions to shed any biases they bring with them from their own culture. For example, they must make sure they construct measures that are meaningful for each of the cultural or ethnic minority groups being studied.
In conducting research on cultural and ethnic minority issues, investigators distinguish between the emic approach and the etic approach. In the emic approach, the goal is to describe behavior in one culture or ethnic group in terms that are meaningful and important to the people in that culture or ethnic group, without regard to other cultures or ethnic groups. In the etic approach, the goal is to describe behavior so that generalizations can be made across cultures. If researchers construct a questionnaire in anemic fashion, the concern is only that the questions are meaningful to the particular culture or ethnic group being studied. If, however, the researchers construct a questionnaire in an etic fashion, they want to include questions that reflect concepts familiar to all cultures involved.
How might the emic and etic approaches be reflected in the study of family processes? In the emic approach, the researchers might choose to focus only on middle-class White families, without regard for whether the information obtained in the study can be generalized or is appropriate for ethnic minority groups. In a subsequent study, the researchers may decide to adopt an etic approach by studying not only middle-class White families, but also lower-income White families, Black American families, Spanish American families, and Asian American families. In studying ethnic minority families, the researchers would likely discover that the extended family is more frequently a support system in ethnic minority families than in White American families. If so, the emic approach would reveal a different pattern of family interaction than would the etic approach, documenting that research with middle-class White families cannot always be generalized to all ethnic groups.
36. According to the first paragraph, researchers unfamiliar with the target cultures are inclined to ________.
A) be overcautious in constructing meaningful measures
B) view them from their own cultural perspective
C) guard against interference from their own culture
D) accept readily what is alien to their own culture
37. What does the author say about the emic approach and the etic approach?
A) They have different research focuses in the study of ethnic issues.
B) The former is biased while the latter is objective.
C) The former concentrates on the study of culture while the latter on family issues.
D) They are both heavily dependent on questionnaires in conducting surveys.
38. Compared with the etic approach, the emic approach is apparently more ________.
A) culturally interactive
B) culturally biased
C) culture-oriented
D) culture-specific
39. The etic approach is concerned with ________.
A) the general characteristics of minority families
B) culture-related concepts of individual ethnic groups
C) features shared by various cultures or ethnic groups
D) the economic conditions of different types of families
40. Which of the following is true of the ethnic minority families in the ________ U.S. according to the passage?
A) Their cultural patterns are usually more adaptable.
B) Their cultural concepts are difficult to comprehend.
C) They don’t interact with each other so much as White families.
D) They have closer family ties than White families.

A great many cities are experiencing difficulties which are nothing new in the history of cities, except in their scale.
Some cities have lost their original purpose and have not found new one. And any large or rich city is going to attract poor (S1) immigrants, who flood in, filling with hopes of prosperity (S2) which are then often disappointing. There are backward towns on the edge of Bombay or Brasilia, just as though there were (S3) on the edge of seventeenth-century London or early nineteenth century Paris. This is new is in the scale. Descriptions (S4) written by eighteenth-century travelers of the poor of Mexico City, and the enormous contrasts that was to be found there, (S5) are very dissimilar to descriptions of Mexico City today―the (S6) poor can still be numbered in millions.
The whole monstrous growth rests on economic prosperity, but behind it lies two myths: the myth of the city as a (S7) promised land, that attracts immigrants from rural poverty (S8) and brings it flooding into city centers, and the myth of the (S9) country as a Garden of Eden, which, a few generations late, (S10) sends them flooding out again to the suburbs.

Student Use of Computers
Students tend to use computers more nowadays. Reading this chart, we can find that the average number of hours a student spends on the computer per week has increased sharply. In 1990, it was less than 2 hours; and in 1995, it increased to almost 4 hours, and in 2000, the number soared to 20 hours.
Obviously computers are becoming more and more popular. There are several reasons for this. First, computers facilitate us in more aspects of life. Also, the fast development of the Internet enlarges our demands for using computers, we can easily contact with friends in remote places through the Internet. Besides, the prices of computers are getting lower and lower, which enables more students to purchase them.
However, there still exist some problem, such as, poor quality, out-of-date designs and so on. And how to balance the time between using computers and studying is also a serious problem.
Anyhow, we will benefit a lot from computers as long as we use them properly.

Section B
Passage One
Jane Brown, has been married for 12 years, she has three children and lives in a suburb outside Columbus Ohio. When her youngest child reached school age, Jane decided to go back to work. She felt that she should contribute to the household finances. Her salary could make the difference between the financial struggle and a secure financial situation for her family. Jane also felt bored and frustrated in her role as a home maker and wanted to be more involved in life outside her home. Jane was worried about the children’s adjustment to this new situation, but she arranged for them to go stay with a woman nearby after school each afternoon. They seemed to be happy with the arrangement. The problem seemed to be between Jane and her husband Bill.
When Jane was at home all day, she was able to clean the house, go grocery shopping, wash the clothes, take care of the children and cook the two or three meals each day. She was very busy, of course, but she succeeded in getting everything done. Now these same things need to be done, but Jane has only evenings and early mornings to do them. Both Jane and Bill are tired when they arrived at home at six p.m. Bill is accustomed to sitting down and reading the paper or watching
TV until the dinner is ready. This is exactly what Jane feels like doing, but someone has to fix the dinner, and Bill expects it to be Jane. Jane is becoming very angry at B ill’s attitude. She feels that they should share the household jobs. But Bill feels that everything should be the same as it was before when back to work.
11. Why did Jane want to go back to work?
12. How did Jane spend her days before she went back to work?
13. What problem arose when Jane went back to work?
14. What does the story try to tell us?
Passage Two
The decade for natural disaster reduction is a programme designed to reduce the impact of natural disasters throughout the world. With the support from the UN, countries will be encouraged to share information about disaster reduction, for instance, information about how to plan for and cope with hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. One of the most important things the programme plans to do is to remind us of what we can do to protect ourselves. For example, we can pack a suitcase with flashlights, a radio, food, drinking water and some tools. This safety case may help us survive disaster until help arrives. Besides, the programmes will encourage governments to establish building standards, emergency response plan and training plans. These measures can help to limit the destruction by natural disasters. The comparatively mild-effects of the northern California earthquake in 1989, are good evidence that we do have the technology to prevent vast destruction. The recent disasters, on the other hand, prove that people will suffer if we don’t use that technology. When a highway collapsed in northern California, people were killed in their cars. The highway was not built according to stricter standards to resist earthquakes. Individuals and governments have to be far-sighted. We should take extra time and spend extra money to build disaster safety into our lives. Although such programme can’t hold back the winds or stop earthquakes, they can save people’s lives and homes.
15. What is the purpose of the programme mentioned in this passage?
16. What can we learn from the northern California earthquake in 1989?
17. Why did the highway in northern California collapse?
Passage Three
Living at the foot of one of the most active volcanoes might not appeal to you at all. But believe it or not, the area surrounding Mount Etna in Italy is packed with people. In fact, it is the most densely-populated region on the whole island of Sicily. The reason is that rich volcanic soil makes the land fantastic for farming. By growing and selling a variety of crops, local people earn a good living.
For them, the economic benefit they reap surpasses the risk of dying or losing property in one of volcanoes frequent eruptions. People everywhere make decisions about risky situations this way, that is, by comparing the risks and the benefits. According to the experts, the size of the risks depends on both its probability and seriousness. Let’s take Mount Etna for example, it does erupt frequently
, but thousands of the eruptions are usually minor, so the overall risk for people living nearby is relatively small. But suppose Mount Etna erupted every day, or imagine that each eruption there killed thousands of people, if that were the case, the risk would be much larger. Indeed, the risk would be too large for many people to live with and they would have to move away.
18. How do people make decisions about risky situations?
19. What do we know about Mount Etna from the passage?
20. What will people living near Mount Etna do in the face of its eruptions?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Bill Gates, the billionaire Microsoft chairman without a single earned university degree, is by his success raising new doubts about the worth of the business world’s favorite academic title: the MBA (Master of Business Administration).
The MBA, a 20th-century product, always has borne the mark of lowly commerce and greed (贪婪) on the tree-lined campuses ruled by purer disciplines such as philosophy and literature.
But even with the recession apparently cutting into the hiring of business school graduates, about 79,000 people are expected to receive MBAs in 1993. This is nearly 16 times the number of business graduates in 1960, a testimony to the wide spread assumption that the MBA is vital for young men and women who want to run companies some day.
“If you are going into the corporate world it is still a disadvantage not to have one,” said Donald Morrison, professor of marketing and management science. “But in the last five years or so, when someone says, ‘Should I attempt to get an MBA,’ the answer a lot more is: It depends.”
The success of Bill Gates and other non-MBAs, such as the late Sam Walton of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has helped inspire self-conscious debates on business school campuses over the worth of a business degree and whether management skills can be taught.
The Harvard Business Review printed a lively, fictional exchange of letters to dramatize complaints about business degree holders.
The article called MBA hires “extremely disappointing” and said “MBAs want to move up too fast, they don’t understand politics and people, and they aren’t able to function as part of a team until their third year. But by then, they’re out looking for other jobs.”
The problem, most participants in the debate acknowledge, is that the MBA has acquired an aura (光环) of future riches and power far beyond its actual importance and usefulness.
Enrollment in business schools exploded in the 1970s and 1980s and created the assumption that no one who pursued a business career could do without one. The growth was fueled by a backlash (反冲) against the anti-business values of the 1960s and by the women’s movement.
Business people who have hired or worked with MBAs say those with the degrees of ten know how to analyze systems but are not so skillful at motivating people. “They don’t get a lot of grounding in the people side of the business”, said James Shaffer, vice-president and principal of the Towers Perrin management consulting firm.
21. According to Paragraph 2, what is the general attitude towards business on campuses dominated by purer disciplines?
A) Scornful.
B) Appreciative.
C) Envious.
D) Realistic.
22. It seems that the controversy over the value of MBA degrees had been fueled mainly by ________.
A) the complaints from various employers
B) the success of many non-MBAs
C) the criticism from the scientists of purer disciplines
D) the poor performance of MBAs at work
23. What is the major weakness of MBA holders according to the Harvard Business Review?
A) They are usually self-centered.
B) They are aggressive and greedy.
C) They keep complaining about their jobs.
D) They are not good at dealing with people.
24. From the passage we know that most MBAs ________.
A) can climb the corporate ladder fairly quickly
B) quit their jobs once they are familiar with their workmates
C) receive salaries that do not match their professional training
D) cherish unrealistic expectations about their future
25. What is the passage mainly about?
A) Why there is an increased enrollment in MBA programs.
B) The necessity of reforming MBA programs in business schools.
C) Doubts about the worth of holding an MBA degree.
D) A debate held recently on university campuses.
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
When school officials in Kalkaska, Michigan, closed classes last week, the media flocked to the story, portraying the town’s 2,305 students as victims of stingy (吝啬的) taxpayers. There is some truth to that; the property-tax rate here is one-third lower than the state average. But shutting their schools also allowed Kalkask’s educators and the state’s largest teachers’ union, the Michigan Education Association, to make a political point. Their aim was to spur passage of legislation Michigan lawmakers are debating to increase the state’s share of school funding.
It was no coincidence that Kalkaska shut its schools two weeks after residents rejected a 28 percent property-tax increase. The school board argued that without the increase it lacked the $1.5 million needed to keep schools open.
But the school system had not done all it could to keep the schools open. Officials declined to borrow against next year’s state aid, they refused to trim extra curricular activities and they did not consider seeking a smaller―perhaps more acceptable―tax increase. In fact, closing early is costing Kalkaska a significant amount, including $600,000 in unemployment payments to teachers and staff and $250,000 in lost state aid. In February, the school system promised teachers and staff two months of retirement payments in case schools closed early, a deal that will cost the district $275,000 more.
Other signs suggest school authorities were at least as eager to make a political statement as to keep schools open. The Michigan Education Association hired a public relations firm to stage a rally marking the school closing, which attracted 14 local and national television stations and networks. The president of the National Education Association, the MEA’s parent organization, flew from Washington, D. C., for the event. And the union tutored school officials in the art of television interviews. School supervisor Doyle Disbrow acknowledges the district could have kept schools open by cutting programs but denies the moves were politically motivated.
Michigan lawmakers have reacted angrily to the closings. The state Senate has al ready voted to put the system into receivership (破产管理) and reopen schools immediately; the Michigan House plans to consider the bill this week.
26. We learn from the passage that schools in Kalkaska, Michigan, are funded ________.
A) by both the local and state governments
B) exclusively by the local government
C) mainly by the state government
D) by the National Education Association
27. One of the purposes for which school officials closed classes was ________.
A) to avoid paying retirement benefits to teachers and staff
B) to draw the attention of local taxpayers to political issues
C) to make the financial difficulties of their teachers and staff known to the public
D) to pressure Michigan lawmakers into increasing state funds for local schools
28. The author seems to disapprove of ________.
A) the Michigan lawmakers’ endless debating
B) the shutting of schools in Kalkaska
C) the involvement of the mass media
D) delaying the passage of the school funding legislation
29. We learn from the passage that school authorities in Kalkaska are concerned about ________.
A) a raise in the property-tax rate in Michigan
B) reopening the schools there immediately
C) the attitude of the MEA’s parent organization
D) making a political issue of the closing of the schools
30. According to the passage, the closing of the schools developed into a crisis because of ________.
A) the complexity of the problem
B) the political motives on the part of the educators
C) the weak response of the state officials
D) the strong protest on the part of the students’ parents
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
German Chancellor (首相) Otto Von Bismarck may be most famous for his military and diplomatic talent, but his legacy (遗产) includes many of today’s social insurance programs. During the middle of the 19th century, Germany, along with other European nations, experienced an unprecedented rash of workplace deaths and accidents as a result of growing industrialization. Motivated in part by Christian compassion (怜悯) for the helpless as well as a practical political impulse to undercut the support of the socialist labor movement, Chancellor Bismarck created the world’s first workers’ compensation law in 1884.
By 1908, the United States was the only industrial nation in the world that lacked workers’ compensation insurance. America’s injured workers could sue for damages in a court of law, but they still faced a number of tough legal barriers. For example, employees had to prove that their injuries directly resulted from employer negligence and that they themselves were ignorant about potential hazards in the workplace. The first state workers’ compensation law in this country passed in 1911, and the program soon spread throughout the nation.
After World War II, benefit payments to American workers did not keep up with the cost of living. In fact, real benefit levels were lower in the 1970s than they were in the 1940s, and in most states the maximum benefit was below the poverty level for a family of four. In 1970, President Richard Nixon set up a national commission to study the problems of workers’ compensation. Two years later, the commission issued 19 key recommendations, including one that called for increasing compensation benefit levels to 100 percent of the states’ average weekly wages.
In fact, the average compensation benefit in America has climbed from 55 percent of the states’ average weekly wages in 1972 to 97 percent today. But, as most studies show, every 10 percent increase in compensation benefits results in a 5 per cent increase in the numbers of workers who file for claims. And with so much more money floating in the workers’ compensation system, it’s not surprising that doctors and lawyers have helped themselves to a large slice of the growing pie.
31. The world’s first workers’ compensation law was introduced by Bismarck ________.
A) to make industrial production safer
B) to speed up the pace of industrialization
C) out of religious and political considerations
D) for fear of losing the support of the socialist labor movement
32. We learn from the passage that the process of industrialization in Europe ________.
A) was accompanied by an increased number of workshop accidents
B) resulted in the development of popular social insurance programs
C) required workers to be aware of the potential dangers at the workplace
D) met growing resistance from laborers working at machines
33. One of the problems the American injured workers faced in getting compensation in the early 19th century was that ________.
A) they had to have the courage to sue for damages in a court of law
B) different states in the U.S. had totally different compensation programs
C) America’s average compensation benefit was much lower than the cost of living
D) they had to produce evidence that their employers were responsible for the accident
34. After 1972 workers’ compensation insurance in the U.S. became more favorable to workers so that ________.
A) the poverty level for a family of four went up drastically
B) there were fewer legal barriers when they filed for claims
C) the number of workers suing for damages increased
D) more money was allocated to their compensation system
35. The author ends the passage with the implication that ________.
A) compensation benefits in America are soaring to new heights
B) the workers are not the only ones to benefit from the compensation system
C) people from all walks of life can benefit from the compensation system
D) money floating in the compensation system is a huge drain on the U.S. economy
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Early in the age of affluence (富裕) that followed World War II, an American retailing analyst named Victor Lebow proclaimed, “Our enormously productive economy... We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever increasing rate.”
Americans have responded to Lebow’s call, and much of the world has followed.
Consumption has become a central pillar of life in industrial lands and is even embedded in social values. Opinion surveys in the world’s two largest economies―Japan and the United States―show consumerist definitions of success becoming ever prevalent.
Overconsumption by the world’s fortunate is an environmental problem unmatched in severity by anything but perhaps population growth. Their surging exploitation of resources threatens to exhaust or unalterably spoil forests, soils, water, air and climate.
Ironically, high consumption may be a mixed blessing in human terms, too. The time-honored values of integrity of character, good work, friendship, family and community have often been sacrificed in the rush to riches.
Thus many in the industrial lands have a sense that their world of plenty is somehow hollow―that, misled by a consumerist culture, they have been fruitlessly attempting to satisfy what are essentially social, psychological and spiritual needs with material things.
Of course, the opposite of over-consumption―poverty―is no solution to either environmental or human problems. It is infinitely worse for people and bad for the natural world too. Dispossessed (被剥夺得一无所有的) peasants slash-and-burn their way into the rain forests of Latin America, and hungry nomads (游牧民族) turn their herds out onto fragile African grassland, reducing it to desert.
If environmental destruction results when people have either too little or too much, we are left to wonder how much is enough. What level of consumption can the earth support? When does having more cease to add noticeably to human satisfaction?
36. The emergence of the affluent society after World War II ________.
A) gave birth to a new generation of upper class consumers
B) gave rise to the dominance of the new egoism
C) led to the reform of the retailing system
D) resulted in the worship of consumerism
37. Apart from enormous productivity, another important impetus to high consumption is ________.
A) the conversion of the sale of goods into rituals
B) the people’s desire for a rise in their living standards
C) the imbalance that has existed between production and consumption
D) the concept that one’s success is measured by how much they consume
38. Why does the author say high consumption is a mixed blessing?
A) Because poverty still exists in an affluent society.
B) Because moral values are sacrificed in pursuit of material satisfaction.
C) Because overconsumption won’t last long due to unrestricted population growth.
D) Because traditional rituals are often neglected in the process of modernization.
39. According to the passage, consumerist culture ________.
A) cannot thrive on a fragile economy
B) will not aggravate environmental problems
C) cannot satisfy human spiritual needs
D) will not alleviate poverty in wealthy countries
40. It can be inferred from the passage that ________.
A) human spiritual needs should match material affluence
B) there is never an end to satisfying people’s material needs
C) whether high consumption should be encouraged is still an issue
D) how to keep consumption at a reasonable level remains a problem

Section B
Passage One
There are some serious problems in the Biramichi river. The local chamber of commerce, which represents the industry in the area, hired me as a consultant to do a one year study on fishing in the Biramichi river and write a rep ort for them. This is my report:
One of the major problems in the Biramichi river is that the level of oxygen in the water is too low. Several chemicals have displaced the oxygen. This chemical pollution has two sources: the factories which dump polluted water directly into the river and the local community which dumps untreated human wastes into the river. The local town government has already spent 2 million dollars on waste water treatment projects, but it will cost another 27 million to complete the projects. It will take at least 15 years for the town to collect enough revenue from taxes to complete these projects. The factories here employ 17,000 people in an area where there is very little alternative employment. It is not economically practical to close or relocate the factories. Also the factories cannot afford to finance chemical treatment plants by themselves. Another problem is that the members of the Biramichi fishing cooperative are overfishing. Fishes are caught when they are on the way upstream to lay eggs. Consequently, not enough fish are left to reproduce in large number. The members of cooperative say that they had already reduced their annual catch by 50 percent. However, my studies indicate that they took fewer fish because there were fewer fish to catch, not because they were trying to preserve fishes.
11. What was the speaker assigned to do in the past year?
12. What is one of the problems in the Biramichi river?
13. What does the passage tell us about the factories along the river?
14. Why was the annual catch of fish in the Biramichi river reduced according to the speaker?
Passage Two
Everybody has to die someday, but nobody likes to think about it. Even so, at sometime in their lives, most people manage to think about the question of how to make a will. If you have already made yours, it is probably just a few pages of writing, stating that you wish to leave everything to your family. That is the kind of will that the majority of people make. However, there are plenty of ways to make your will more interesting if you want to. To begin with, you don’t have to write it on paper. One man wrote his will on an envelope, another on the door, and a third on an egg. For some people, the most important part of their will is the part that says how they want to be buried. Mrs. Sandra West, a rich widow from Texas, decided that she wanted to be buried with her favorite car. In 1973, Mr. Green, a dentist from England, left most of his money to the nurse who worked for him if in 5 years she would not wear any kind of make-up or jewel or go out with men. Finally, let’s hope that your will is not like that of Dr. Wagner, who lived in America 100 years ago. His family, who had not been to see him for years, suddenly began to visit him when he became ill. What was worse, each person suggested to Dr. Wagner that they would like something to remember him by when he died. Greatly annoyed with them, Dr. Wagner wrote a will that would do this: to each of his four brothers, he left one of his legs or arms, his nephew got his nose and his two nieces each got an ear. His teeth went to his cousin. Then he set aside 1,000 dollars to pay for cutting his body and the rest of his money he left to the poor.
15. What kind of will do most people leave behind according to the passage?
16. What did the nurse have to do before getting the money left by the English dentist?
17. Why did Dr. Wagner make an unusual will?
Passage Three
In recent years, there has been an unusually large number of divorces in the United States. In the past, when two people married each other, they intended to stay together for life. While today, many people marry believing that they can always get it divorce if the marriage does not work out. In the past, a large majority of the Americans frowned at the idea of divorce. Furthermore, many people believed that getting a divorce was a luxury that only the rich could afford. Indeed, getting a divorce was very expensive. However, since so many people have began to take a more casual view of marriage, it is interesting to know that the cost of get ting a divorce is lower. In fact, wherever you go in the United States today, it is not unusual to see newspaper ads that provide information on how and where to get a cheap divorce. Hollywood has always been known as the divorce capital of the world. The divorce rate among the movie stars is so high that it is difficult to know who is married to whom. Today many movie stars change husbands and wives as though they were changing clothes. Until marriage again become the serious and important part of people’s lives, we will probably continue to see a high rate of divorce.
18. What did many Americans think of divorce in the past?
19. What is the attitude of many Americans to marriage today?
20. In the speaker’s view, when will the high rate of divorce be brought down?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
In the villages of the English countryside there are still people who remember the good old days when no one bothered to lock their doors. There simply wasn’t any crime to worry about.
Amazingly, these happy times appear still to be with us in the world’s biggest community. A new study by Dan Farmer, a gifted programmer, using an automated investigative program of his own called SATAN, shows that the owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up home without fitting locks to their doors.
SATAN can try out a variety of well-known hacking (黑客的) tricks on an Internet site without actually breaking in. Farmer has made the program publicly available, amid much criticism. A person with evil intent could use it to hunt down sites that are easy to burgle (闯入…...行窃).
But Farmer is very concerned about the need to alert the public to poor security and, so far, events have proved him right. SATAN has done more to alert people to the risks than cause new disorder. So is the Net becoming more secure? Far from it. In the early days, when you visited a Web site your browser simply looked at the content. Now the Web is full of tiny programs that automatically download when you look at a Web page, and run on your own machine. These programs could, if their authors wished, do all kinds of nasty things to your computer.
At the same time, the Net is increasingly populated with spiders, worms, agents and other types of automated beasts designed to penetrate the sites and seek out and classify information. All these make wonderful tools for antisocial people who want to invade weak sites and cause damage.
But let’s look on the bright side. Given the lack of locks, the Internet is surely the world’s biggest (almost) crime-free society. Maybe that is because hackers are fundamentally honest. Or that there currently isn’t much to steal. Or because vandalism ( 恶意破坏) isn’t much fun unless you have a peculiar dislike for someone.
Whatever the reason, let’s enjoy it while we can. But expect it all to change, and security to become the number one issue, when the most influential inhabitants of the Net are selling services they want to be paid for.
21. By saying “... owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up home without fitting locks to their doors” (Lines 3-4, Para. 2), the author means that ________.
A) those happy times appear still to be with us
B) there simply wasn’t any crime to worry about
C) many sites are not well-protected
D) hackers try out tricks on an Internet site without actually breaking in
22. SATAN, a program designed by Dan Fanner can be used ________.
A) to investigate the security of Internet sites
B) to improve the security of the Internet system
C) to prevent hackers from breaking into websites
D) to download useful programs and information
23. Fanner’s program has been criticized by the public because.
A) it causes damage to Net browsers
B) it can break into Internet sites
C) it can be used to cause disorder on all sites
D) it can be used by people with evil intent
24. The author’s attitude toward SATAN is ________.
A) enthusiastic
B) critical
C) positive
D) indifferent
25. The author suggests in the last paragraph that ________.
A) we should make full use of the Internet before security measures are strengthened
B) we should alert the most influential businessmen to the importance of security
C) influential businessmen should give priority to the improvement of Net security
D) net inhabitants should not let security measures affect their joy of surfing the Internet
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
I came away from my years of teaching on the college and university level with a conviction that enactment (扮演角色), performance, dramatization are the most successful forms of teaching. Students must be incorporated, made, so far as possible, an integral part of the learning process. The notion that learning should have in it an element of inspired play would seem to the greater part of the academic establishment merely silly, but that is nonetheless the case. Of Ezekiel Cheever, the most famous schoolmaster of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, his onetime student Cotton Mather wrote that he so planned his lessons that his pupils “came to work as though they came to play,” and Alfred North Whitehead, almost three hundred years later, noted that a teacher should make his/her students “glad they were there.”
Since, we are told, 80 to 90 percent of all instruction in the typical university is by the lecture method, we should give close attention to this form of education. There is, I think, much truth in Patricia Nelson Limerick’s observation that “lecturing is an unnatural act, an act for which God did not design humans. It is perfectly all right, now and then, for a human to be possessed by the urge to speak, and to speak while others remain silent. But to do this regularly, one hour and 15 minutes at a time... for one person to drag on while others sit in silence?... I do not believe that this is what the Creator... designed humans to do.”
The strange, almost incomprehensible fact is that many professors, just as they feel obliged to write dully, believe that they should lecture dully. To show enthusiasm is to risk appearing unscientific, unobjective; it is to appeal to the students’ emotions rather than their intellect. Thus the ideal lecture is one filled with facts and read in an unchanged monotone.
The cult (推崇) of lecturing dully, like the cult of writing dully, goes back, of course, some years. Edward Shils, professor of sociology, recalls the professors he encountered at the University of Pennsylvania in his youth. They seemed “a priesthood, rather uneven in their merits but uniform in their bearing; they never referred to anything personal. Some read from old lecture notes and then haltingly explained the thumb-worn last lines. Others lectured from cards that had served for years, to judge by the worn edges... The teachers began on time, ended on time, and left the room without saying a word more to their students, very seldom being detained by questioners... The classes were not large, yet there was no discussion. No questions were raised in class, and there were no office hours.”
26. The author believes that a successful teacher should be able to ________.
A) make dramatization an important aspect of students’ learning
B) make inspired play an integral part of the learning process
C) improve students’ learning performance
D) make study just as easy as play
27. The majority of university professors prefer the traditional way of lecturing in the belief that ________.
A) it draws the close attention of the students
B) it conforms in a way to the design of the Creator
C) it presents course content in a scientific and objective manner
D) it helps students to comprehend abstract theories more easily
28. What the author recommends in this passage is that ________.
A) college education should be improved through radical measures
B) more freedom of choice should be given to students in their studies
C) traditional college lectures should be replaced by dramatized performances
D) interaction should be encouraged in the process of teaching
29. By saying “They seemed ‘a priesthood, rather uneven in their merits but uniform in their bearing...’” (Lines 3-4, Para. 4), the author means that ________.
A) professors are a group of professionals that differ in their academic ability but behave in the same way
B) professors are like priests wearing the same kind of black gown but having different roles to play
C) there is no fundamental difference between professors and priests though they differ in their merits

Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Take the case of public education alone. The principal difficulty faced by the schools has been the tremendous increase in the number of pupils. This has been caused by the advance of the legal age for going into industry and the impossibility of finding a job even when the legal age has been reached. In view of the technological improvements in the last few years, business will require in the future proportionately fewer workers than ever before. The result will be still further raising of he legal age for going into employment, and still further difficulty in finding employment when hat age has been attained. If we cannot put our children to work, we must put them in school.
We may also be quite confident that the present trend toward a shorter day and a shorter week will be maintained. We have developed and shall continue to have a new leisure class. Already the public agencies for adult education are swamped by the tide that has swept over them since depression began. They will be little better off when it is over. Their support must come from the taxpayer.
It is surely too much to hope that these increases in the cost of public education can be borne by the local communities. They cannot care for the present restricted and inadequate system. The local communities have failed in their efforts to cope with unemployment. They cannot expect to cope with public education on the scale on which we must attempt it. The answer to the problem of unemployment has been Federal relief. The answer to the problem of public education may have to be much the same, and properly so. If there is one thing in which the citizens of all parts of the country have an interest, it is in the decent education of the citizens of all parts of the country. Our income tax now goes in part to keep our neighbors alive. It may have to go in part as well to make our neighbors intelligent. We are now attempting to preserve the present generation through Federal relief of the destitute (贫民). Only a people determined to ruin the next generation will refuse such Federal funds as public education may require.
31. What is the passage mainly about?
A) How to persuade local communities to provide more funds.
B) How to cope with the shortage of funds for public education.
C) How to solve the rising unemployment problem.
D) How to improve the public education system.
32. What is the reason for the increase in the number of students?
A) The requirement of educated workers by business.
B) Raising of the legal age for going to work.
C) The trend toward a shorter workday.
D) People’s concern for the future of the next generation.
33. The public agencies for adult education will be little better off because ________.
A) the unemployed are too poor to continue their education
B) a new leisure class has developed
C) they are still suffering from the depression
D) an increase in taxes could be a problem
34. According to the author, the answer to the problem of public education is that the Federal government ________.
A) should allocate Federal funds for public education
B) should demand that local communities provide support
C) should raise taxes to meet the needs of public education
D) should first of all solve the problem of unemployment
35. Why does the author say “Only a people determined to ruin the next generation will refuse such Federal funds as public education may require” (Lines 10-11, Para. 3)?
A) Only by appropriating adequate Federal funds for education can the next generation have a bright future.
B) Citizens of all parts of the country agree that the best way to support education is to use Federal funds.
C) People all over the country should make contributions to education in the interest of the next generation.
D) Educated people are determined to use part of the Federal funds to help the poor.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
A new high-performance contact lens under development at the department for applied physics at the University of Heidelberg will not only correct ordinary vision defects but will enhance normal night vision as much as five times, making people’s vision sharper than that of cats.
Bille and his team work with an optical instrument called an active mirror―a device used in astronomical telescopes to spot newly emerging stars and far distant galaxies. Connected to a wave-front sensor that tracks and measures the course of a laser beam into the eye and back, the aluminum mirror detects the deficiencies of the cornea, the transparent protective layer covering the lens of the human eye. The highly precise data from the two instruments―which, Bille hopes, will one day be found at the opticians (眼镜商) all over the world―serve as a basis for the production of completely individualized contact lenses that correct and enhance the wearer’s vision.
By day, Bille’s contact lenses will focus rays of light so accurately on the retina （视网膜）that the image of a small leaf or the outline of a far distant tree will be formed with a sharpness that surpasses that of conventional vision aids by almost half a diopter ( 屈光度). At night, the lenses have an even greater potential. “Because the new lens―in contrast to the already existing ones―also works when it’s dark and the pupil is wide open,” says Bille, “lens wearers will be able to identify a face at a distance of 100 meters”―80 meters farther than they would normally be able to see. In his experiments night vision was enhanced by an even greater factor: in semi-darkness, test subjects could see up to 15 times better than without the lenses.
Bille’s lenses are expected to reach the market in the year 2000, and one tentative plan is to use the Internet to transmit information on patients’ visual defects from the optician to the manufacturer, who will then produce and mail the contact lenses within a couple of days. The physicist expects the lenses to cost about a dollar a pair, about the same as conventional one-day disposable lenses.
36. The new contact lens is meant for ________.
A) astronomical observations
B) the night blind
C) those with vision defects
D) optical experiments
37. What do the two instruments mentioned in the second paragraph (Line 5) refer to?
A) The astronomical telescope and the wave-front sensor.
B) The aluminum mirror and the laser beam.
C) The active mirror and the contact lens.
D) The aluminum mirror and the wave-front sensor.
38. Individualized contact lenses (Line 7, Para. 2) are lenses designed ________.
A) to work like an astronomical telescope
B) to suit the wearer’s specific needs
C) to process extremely accurate data
D) to test the wearer’s eyesight
39. According to Bille, with the new lenses the wearer’s vision ________.
A) will be far better at night than in the daytime
B) may be broadened about 15 times than without them
C) can be better improved in the daytime than at night
D) will be sharper by a much greater degree at night than in the daytime
40. Which of the following is true about Bille’s lenses?
A) Their production process is complicated.
B) They will be sold at a very low price.
C) They have to be replaced every day.
D) Purchase orders can be made through the Internet.

Part IV Error Correction (15 minutes)
Directions: This part consists of a short passage. In this passage, there are altogether 10 mistakes, one in each numbered line. You may have to change a word, add a word or delete a word. Mark out the mistakes and put the corrections in the blanks provided. If you change a word, cross it out and write the correct word in the corresponding blank. If you add a word, put an insertion mark () in the right place and write the missing word in the blank. If you delete a word, cross it out and put a slash (/) in the blank.
The Seattle Times Company is one newspaper firm that has recognized the need for change and done something about it. In the newspaper industry, papers must reflect the diversity of the communities to which they provide information.
It must reflect that diversity with their news coverage or risk (S1) losing their readers’ interest and their advertisers’ support.
Operating within Seattle, which has 20 percents racial (S2) minorities, the paper has put into place policies and procedures for hiring and maintain a diverse workforce. The (S3) underlying reason for the change is that for information to be fair, appropriate, and subjective, it should be reported by the (S4) same kind of population that reads it.
A diversity committee composed of reporters, editors, and photographers meets regularly to value the Seattle Times’ (S5) content and to educate the rest of the newsroom staff about diversity issues. In an addition, the paper instituted a content (S6) audit (审查) that evaluates the frequency and manner of representation of woman and people of color in photographs. (S7)
Early audits showed that minorities were pictured far too infrequently and were pictured with a disproportion ate number of negative articles. The audit results from (S8) improvement in the frequency of majority representation and (S9) their portrayal in neutral or positive situations. And, with a (S10) result, the Seattle Times has improved as a newspaper.
The diversity training and content audits helped the Seattle Times Company to win the Personnel Journal Optimal Award for excellence in managing change.

Passage One
A few months ago, millions of people in London heard alarms all over the town. The Emergency services, the Fire Departments, the Police, hospitals, and ambulances stood by, ready to go into action. In railway underground stations, people read notices and maps which told them where to go and what to do in the emergency. This was Exercise Flood Call, to prepare people for a flood emergency. London wasn’t flooded yet, but it is possible that it would be. In 1236 and in 1663, London was badly flooded. In 1928, people living in Westminster, the heart of London, drowned in floods. And in 1953, one hundred people, living on the eastern edge of the London suburbs were killed, again, in the floods. At last, Greater London Council took actions to prevent this disaster from happening again. Though a flood wall was built in the 1960s, Londoners still must be prepared for the possible disaster. If it happens, 50 underground stations will be under water. Electricity, gas and phone services will be out of action. Roads will be drowned. It will be impossible to cross any of the bridges between north and south London. Imagine: London will look like the famous Italian city, Venice. But this Exercise Flood Call didn’t cause panic among Londoners. Most people knew it was just a warning. One lady said, “It’s a flood warning, isn’t it? The water doesn’t look high to me.”
Question 11: What happened in London a few months ago?
Question 12: What measure was taken against floods in London in the 1960s?
Question 13: What can we learnt from the lady’s comment?
Passage Two
America’s national symbol, the bald eagle, almost went extinct twenty years ago, but it has made a comeback. In fact, the U.S. Fish and Wild Life Service is considering the possibility of taking it off the Endangered Species List. Once, more than fifty hundred pairs of bald eagles nested across the country, but by 1960 that number had fallen below four hundred. The chief killer was the widely used DDT. Fish, soaked up DDT, died, and were washed up on shores, where bald eagles feasted on them. DDT prevented eagle egg shells from thickening. The shells became so thin that they shattered before the babies hatched. Fortunately, in 1972, a law was passed to ban DDT, which saved the bald eagle from total wipeout. And since then wild life biologists had reintroduced bald eagles from Canada to America. The result was that last year U.S. bird watchers counted eleven thousand six hundred and ten bald eagles in the country. If it were dropped from the Endangered Species List, the bald eagle would still be a threatened species. That means the bird would continue to get the same protection. No hunting allowed, and no disturbing of nests. But bald eagles still face tough times. The destruction of their natural homes could be the next DDT causing eagle numbers to drop quickly.
Question 14: What was the main harmful effect of the pests killer DDT on bald eagles?
Question 15: What measure did the wild life biologist take to increase the number of bald eagles?
Question 16: According to the speaker, what is the possible danger facing bald eagles?
Passage Three
If the earth gets hotter in the new century, what will happen to animals and the plants which animals depend on for survival? The question offers another way of looking at the “Greenhouse Effect”. People have talked about the general problem of “Global Warming” for some time. But they were usually worried about things like whether to buy a home on the coast. Biologists and other scientists turn their attention to plants and animals at an important meeting that took place last October. They were reviewed evidence that plants and animals are sensitive to climate. Since the Ice Age ended ten thousand years ago and warmer temperatures returned to the northern latitudes, many species have migrated north. If the predictions about the Greenhouse are correct, temperatures will rise by the same amount in the next one hundred years as they did in the past ten thousand. Will animals and plants be able to adapt that quickly to change in the environment? Many won’t. Certain species will probably become very rare. Experts say plants under climate stress will be very open to disease and fire. Forest fires may become more common. That, in turn, man harm animals that depend on the trees for food will for shelter. Any preserves we set up to protect endangered species may become useless as the species are forced to migrate along with their natural homes. Change is a part of life, but rapid change, says scientist George Woodwell, is the enemy of life.
Question 17: What is the concern of ordinary people about the “Greenhouse Effect”?
Question 18: What has happened since the end of the ICE AGE?
Question 19: What will be a possible threat to plants in the future?
Question 20: According to the passage, what will probably happen to the endangered species?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are four passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
In 1985 when a Japan Air Lines (JAL) jet crashed, its president, Yasumoto Takagi, called each victim’s family to apologize, and then promptly resigned. And in 1987, when a subsidiary of Toshiba sole sensitive military technology to the former Soviet Union, the chairman of Toshiba gave up his post.
These executive actions, which Toshiba calls “the highest form of apology,” may seem bizarre to US managers. No one at Boeing resigned after the JAL crash, which may have been caused by a faulty Boeing repair.
The difference between the two business cultures centers around different definitions of delegation.
While US executives give both responsibility and authority to their employees, Japanese executives delegate only authority―the responsibility is still theirs. Although the subsidiary that sold the sensitive technology to the Soviets had its own management, the Toshiba top executives said they “must take personal responsibility for not creating an atmosphere throughout the Toshiba group that would make such activity unthinkable, even in an independently run subsidiary.”
Such acceptance of community responsibility is not unique to businesses in Japan. School principals in Japan have resigned when their students committed major crimes after school hours.
Even if they do not quit, Japanese executives will often accept primary responsibility in other ways, such as taking the first pay cut when a company gets into financial trouble. Such personal sacrifices, even if they are largely symbolic, help to create the sense of community and employee loyalty that is crucial to the Japanese way of doing business.
Harvard Business School professor George Lodge calls the ritual acceptance of blame “almost a feudal (封建的) way of purging (清除) the community of dishonor,” and to some in the United States, such resignations look cowardly. However, in an era in which both business and governmental leaders seem particularly good at evading responsibility, many US managers would probably welcome an infusion (灌输) of the Japanese sense of responsibility. If, for instance, US automobile company executives offered to reduce their own salaries before they asked their workers to take pay cuts, negotiations would probably take on a very different character.
21. Why did the chairman of Toshiba resign his position in 1987?
A) Because in Japan, the leakage of a state secret to Russians is a grave crime.
B) Because he had been under attack for shifting responsibility to his subordinates.
C) Because in Japan, the chief executive of a corporation is held responsible for the mistake made by its subsidiaries.
D) Because he had been accused of being cowardly towards crises that were taking place in his corporation.
22. According to the passage if you want to be a good manager in Japan, you have to ________.
A) apologize promptly for your subordinates’ mistakes
B) be skillful in accepting blames from customers
C) make symbolic sacrifices whenever necessary
D) create a strong sense of company loyalty
23. What’s Professor George Lodge’s attitude towards the resignations of Japanese corporate leaders?
A) Sympathetic.
B) Biased.
C) Critical.
D) Approving.
24. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
A) Boeing had nothing to do with the JAL air crash in 1985.
B) American executives consider authority and responsibility inseparable.
C) School principals bear legal responsibility for students’ crimes.
D) Persuading employees to take pay cuts doesn’t help solve corporate crises.
25. The passage is mainly about ________.
A) resignation as an effective way of dealing with business crises
B) the importance of delegating responsibility to employees
C) ways of evading responsibility in times of crises
D) the difference between two business cultures
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
As machines go, the car is not terribly noisy, nor terribly polluting, nor terribly dangerous; and on all those dimensions it has become better as the century has grown older. The main problem is its prevalence, and the social costs that ensue from the use by everyone of something that would be fairly harmless if, say, only the rich were to use it. It is a price we pay for equality.
Before becoming too gloomy, it is worth recalling why the car has been arguably the most successful and popular product of the whole of the past 100 years―and remains so. The story begins with the environmental improvement it brought in the 1900s. In New York city in 1900, according to the Car Culture, a 1975 book by J. Flink, a historian, horses deposited 2.5 million pounds of manure (粪) and 60,000 gallons of urine (尿) every day. Every year, the city authorities had to remove an average of 15,000 dead horses from the streets, it made cars smell of roses.
Cars were also wonderfully flexible. The main earlier solution to horse pollution and traffic jams was the electric trolley bus (电车). But that required fixed overhead wires, and rails and platforms, which were expensive, ugly, and inflexible. The car could go from any A to any B, and allowed towns to develop in all directions with low-density housing, rather than just being concentrated along the trolley or rail lines. Rural areas benefited too, for they became less remote.
However, since pollution became a concern in the 1950s, experts have predicted―wrongly―that the car boom was about to end. In his book Mr. Flink argued that by 1973 the American market had become saturated, at one car for every 2.25 people, and so had the markets of Japan and Western Europe (because of land shortages). Environmental worries and diminishing oil reserves would prohibit mass car use anywhere else.
He was wrong. Between 1970 and 1990, whereas America’s population grew by 23%, the number of cars on its roads grew by 60%. There is now one car for every 1.7 people there, one for every 2.1 in Japan, one for every 5.3 in Britain. Around 550 million cars are already on the roads, not to mention all the trucks and mocorcyeles, and about 50 million new ones are made each year worldwide. Will it go on? Undoubtedly, because people want it to.
26. As is given in the first paragraph, the reason why the car has become a problem is that ________.
A) poor people can’t afford it
B) it is too expensive to maintain
C) too many people are using it
D) it causes too many road accidents
27. According to the passage, the car started to gain popularity because ________.
A) it didn’t break down as easily as a horse
B) it had a comparatively pleasant odor
C) it caused less pollution than horses
D) it brightened up the gloomy streets
28. What impact did the use of cars have on society?
A) People were compelled to leave downtown areas.
B) People were able to live in less crowded suburban areas.
C) Business along trolley and rail lines slackened.
D) City streets were free of ugly overhead wires.
29. Mr. Flink argued in his book that cars would not be widely used in other countries because ________.
A) the once booming car market has become saturated
B) traffic jams in those countries are getting more and more serious
C) expensive motorways are not available in less developed countries
D) people worry about pollution and the diminishing oil resources
30. What’s wrong with Mr. Flink’s prediction?
A) The use of automobiles has kept increasing worldwide.
B) New generations of cars are virtually pollution free.
C) The population of America has not increased as fast.
D) People’s environmental concerns are constantly increasing.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Crying is hardly an activity encouraged by society. Tears, be they of sorrow, anger, or joy, typically make Americans feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. The shedder of tears is likely to apologize, even when a devastating (毁灭性的) tragedy was the provocation. The observer of tears is likely to do everything possible to put an end to the emotional outpouring. But judging from recent studies of crying behavior, links between illness and crying and the chemical composition of tears, both those responses to tears are often inappropriate and may even be counterproductive.
Humans are the only animals definitely known to shed emotional tears. Since evolution has given rise to few, if any, purposeless physiological responses, it is logical to assume that crying has one or more functions that enhance survival.
Although some observers have suggested that crying is a way to elicit assistance from others (as a crying baby might from its mother), the shedding of tears is hardly necessary to get help. Vocal cries would have been quite enough, more likely than tears to gain attention. So, it appears, there must be something special about tears themselves.
Indeed, the new studies suggest that emotional tears may play a direct role in alleviating stress. University of Minnesota researchers who are studying the chemical composition of tears have recently isolated two important chemicals from emotional tears. Both chemicals are found only in tears that are shed in response to emotion. Tears shed because of exposure to cut onion would contain no such substance.
Researchers at several other institutions are investigating the usefulness of tears as a means of diagnosing human ills and monitoring drugs.
At Tulane University’s Teat Analysis Laboratory Dr. Peter Kastl and his colleagues report that they can use tears to detect drug abuse and exposure to medication (药物), to determine whether a contact lens fits properly of why it may be uncomfortable, to study the causes of “dry eye” syndrome and the effects of eye surgery, and perhaps even to measure exposure to environmental pollutants.
At Columbia University Dr. Liasy Faris and colleagues are studying tears for clues to the diagnosis of diseases away from the eyes. Tears can be obtained painlessly without invading the body and only tiny amounts are needed to perform highly refined analyses.
31. It is known from the first paragraph that ________.
A) shedding tears gives unpleasant feelings to American
B) crying may often imitate people or even result in tragedy
C) crying usually wins sympathy from other people
D) one who sheds tears in public will be blamed
32. What does “both those responses to tears” (Line 5, Para, 1) refer to?
A) Crying out of sorrow and shedding tears for happiness.
B) The embarrassment and unpleasant sensation of the observers.
C) The tear shedder’s apology and the observer’s effort to stop the crying.
D) Linking illness with crying and finding the chemical composition of tears.
33. “Counterproductive” (Lines 5, Para, 1) very probably means “________”.
A) having no effect at all
B) leading to tension
C) producing disastrous impact
D) harmful to health
34. What does the author say about crying?
A) It is a pointless physiological response to the environment.
B) It must have a role to play in man’s survival.
C) It is meant to get attention and assistance.
D) It usually produces the desired effect.
35. What can be inferred from the new studies of tears?
A) Emotional tears have the function of reducing stress.
B) Exposure to excessive medication may increase emotional tears.
C) Emotional tears can give rise to “dry eye” syndrome in some cases.
D) Environmental pollutants can induce the shedding of emotional tears.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
It is no secret among athletes that in order to improve performance you’ve got to work hard.
However, hard training breaks you down and makes you weaker, it is rest that makes you stronger.
Improvement only occurs during the rest period following hard training. This adaptation is accomplished by improving efficiency of the heart and certain systems within the muscle cells.
During recovery periods these systems build to greater levels to compensate for the stress that you have applied. The result is that you are now at a higher level of performance.
If sufficient rest is not included in a training program, imbalance between excess training and inadequate rest will occur, and performance will decline. The “overtraining syndrome (综合症)” is the name given to the collection of emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms due to overtraining that has persisted for weeks to months. It is marked by cumulative exhaustion that persists even after recovery periods.
The most common symptom is fatigue. This may limit workouts and may be present at rest. The athletes may also become moody, easily imitated, have altered sleep patterns, become depressed, or lose the competitive desire and enthusiasm for the sport. Some will report decreased appetite and weight loss. Physical symptoms include persistent muscular soreness, increased frequency of viral (病毒性的) illnesses, and increased incidence of injuries.
The treatment for the overtraining syndrome is rest. The longer the overtraining has occurred, the more rest required, therefore, early detection is very important. If the overtraining has only occurred for a short period of time (e.g. 3-4 weeks) then interrupting training for 3-5 days is usually sufficient rest. It is important that the factors that lead to overtraining be identified and corrected. Otherwise, the overtraining syndrome is likely to recur. The overtraining syndrome should be considered in any athlete who manifests symptoms of prolonged fatigue and whose performance has leveled off or decreased. It is important to exclude any underlying illness that may be responsible for the fatigue.
36. The first paragraph of the passage tells us that ________.
A) the harder an athlete trains, the better his performance will be
B) rest after vigorous training improves an athlete’s performance
C) strict systematic training is essential to an athlete’s top performance
D) improvement of an athlete’s performance occurs in the course of training
37. By “overtraining” the author means ________.
A) a series of physical symptoms that occur after training
B) undue emphasis on the importance of physical exertion
C) training that is not adequately compensated for by rest
D) training that has exceeded an athlete’s emotional limits
38. What does the passage tell us about the “overtraining” syndrome?
A) It occurs when athletes lose interest in sports.
B) It appears right after a hard training session.
C) The fatigue it results in is unavoidable in the athlete’s training process.
D) It manifests itself in fatigue which lingers even after a recovery period.
39. What does the phrase “level off” (Line 5, Para. 4) most probably mean?
A) Slow down.
B) Become dull.
C) Stop improving.
D) Be on the decline.
40. The author advises at the end of the passage that ________.
A) overtraining syndrome should be treated as a serious illness
B) overtraining syndrome should be prevented before it occurs
C) an athlete with overtraining syndrome should take a lengthy rest
D) illness causing fatigue should not be mistaken for overtraining syndrome

“Home, sweet home” is a phrase that expresses an essential attitude in the United States. Whether the reality of life in the family house is sweet or no sweet. The (S1) cherished ideal of home has great importance for many people.
This ideal is a vital part of the American dream. This dream, dramatized in the history of nineteenth century European settlers of the American West, was in find a piece of place, build a house for one’s family, and (S2) started a farm. These small households were portraits of (S3) independence: the entire family―mother, father, children, even grandparents―live in a small house and working (S4) together to support each other.

When U.S. soldiers came home before World War II. for (S7) example, they dreamed of buying houses and starting families. But there was a tremendous boom in home (S8) building. The new houses, typically it the suburbs, were often small and more or less identical, but it satisfied (S9) a deep need. Many regarded the single-family house the basis of their way of life. (S10)

It can be discerned that the American students prefer to read the popular novels rather than any other kind of books, such as the unpopular fictions, technical books, poems and so on. The percentage of the popular novel is about 68.2% currently. Comparatively, other kind of novels is about 16.8%, 8.3%, and 5.2%.
It is not difficult to understand why the popular novels can attract so many students. The popular novel is interesting, and not so abstract as books that are full of the mathematic formulas. However, as university students, study is the primary task for us to do. So it’s advisable that we should pay more attention to the books in our major. Fictions may make our life rich and colorful, but it cannot become the major part of our life.
As far as I am concerned, I would like to spend my spare time on reading academic collection of dissertations, periodicals in my major, such as technology digests, computer newspapers and so forth, because I want to do a good job in my subjects. Fortunately, my dreams come true. Meanwhile, I have gained other things, i.e. I’ve laid a solid foundation in specialized field, which makes me feel easy to contrive the electronic circuits that have to be done during our bachelor years. Thanks to those books!

Passage One
Graffiti is drawing or writing often found in a wall in public places. These drawings and writings are usually rude, humorous, or political. The words Graffiti” comes from an Italian word meaning address. Graffiti provides a record of the past because people have written on walls for centuries. Cave drawings are the earliest examples we have of the art of graffiti.
Writing on walls is a way to comment on the world we live in. Women’s liberation groups in Britain, for example, have used graffiti to show their anger at the sex discrimination of many advertisements where women’s bodies are used to sell goods.
Yesterday’s graffiti can be today’s foreign attraction. When the Berlin wall ca me down in 1989, people found that it was covered with graffiti from all over the world. Graves of famous people, like rock-star Jim Morrison, are covered with written messages from fans.
Graffiti is also a popular art form. Graffiti pictures have gained respect in artistic circles. Today, graffiti is likely to be found hanging inside modern, New York apartments as well as in the downtown streets. In New York, graffiti pictures have been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Graffiti artists have been paid to use their art to brighten up dull environments.
But graffiti can bring us trouble. Scenes of natural beauty and important landmarks have been spoiled by mindless graffiti. The London underground authority has spent about 2 million pounds a year on removing graffiti for trains and stations. If you are caught doing it, you can be sent to person. In Britain, the maxim um sentence for this type of crime is ten years.
Whether you think graffiti is mindless violence against property, or a living art form, its popularity suggests that it is here to stay.
11. What do women’s liberation groups in Britain do with graffiti?
12. What do some New Yorkers think of graffiti?
13. Why does the speaker cite the example of graffiti in the London underground?
Passage Two
The Asian elephant is one of the world’s rarest animal. Unfortunately, its sad condition has not been as well publicized as that of the African elephant. This is because Asian elephant’s ivory supplies only a small percentage of the world ivory trade. In fact, we know very little about the Asian elephant. They live in the remote forests of southern Asia and it is therefore very difficult to study them. Most knowledge of Asian elephants is from those that have been captured, or tamed. Asian elephants are easier to tame than African elephants. The elephants you see in the circuses and zoos are nearly always Asian.
The major reason for the decline of Asian elephants is the harm to their forests. The huge increase in the human population has caused the destruction of the Asian forest for human population. As a result, the Asian elephants are compelled to scatter in different areas. Originally they lived all over the continent, but now there are only small isolated populations left. These isolated elephant populations are vulnerable to extinction.
While Asian elephants are threatened by illegal capture and detaining, they are also killed for ivory and skin. In July 1990, a British wildlife group uncovered a black market for elephant skin. Elephants are shot in the forest along the border between Thailand and Burma, and their skin was sold to factories in Bangkok. T heir skin is made into shoes, belts, suitcases, wallets, etc, to sell to tourists.
14. What’s the difference between the Asian elephant and the African elephant?
15. Where does most knowledge of Asian elephants come from?
16. What’s the major cause in the decline of Asian elephants?
Passage Three
After the early period of settlements, the first sharp increase in immigration took place in the 1830’s and 1840’s. This brought to America flocks of people from northern Europe who lost employment in the Industrial Revolution, and then a great number of Irish people who fled from famine. German political refugees arrived shortly after. Many immigrants from northern and western Europe settled on farms in the Middle-west. The Irish became construction laborers on roads, bridges, and railroads.
In the 1880’s, a tremendous flood of immigrants began coming in, this time largely from southern and eastern Europe. To most Americans, these newcomers seemed far more strange than the early settlers. Their languages, customs, and ways of life were very different from those of Americans. The newcomers moved into the poorest neighborhood of the large cities. They tended to stay together and cling to their old ways. As they were accustomed to poverty, they were willing to work for very low wages. This made other workers, especially those in labor unions, afraid that the immigrants with the lower wage level would take jobs away from them. Indeed, organized labor became one of the key opponents of continued immigration.
This opposition finally lead to the posting of immigration law in the 1920’s, which restricted further immigration. In 1965, these unfair laws were replaced by a new immigration act, which granted equal opportunities to foreigners, regardless of their place of origin. Asians, like Koreans and Vietnamese, soon began to arrive. Many of these newcomers have worked very hard to establish themselves in their new land.
17. Why did northern European people come to settle down in the United States?
18. What did the labor unions worry about?
19. What was the purpose of the immigration law passed in the 1920’s?
20. What do we know from the passage about Asian immigrants?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are four passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
For years, doctors advised their patients that the only thing taking multivitamins does is give them extensive urine (尿). After all, true vitamin deficiencies are practically unheard of in industrialized countries. Now it seems those doctors may have been wrong. The results of a growing number of studies suggest that even a modest vitamin shortfall can be harmful to your health. Although proof of the benefits of multivitamins is still far from certain, the few dollars you spend on them is probably a good investment.
Or at least that’s the argument put forward in the New England Journal of Medicine. Ideally, say Dr. Walter Willett and Dr. Meir Stampfer of Harvard, all vitamin supplements would be evaluated in scientifically rigorous clinical trials.
But those studies can take a long time and often raise more questions than they answer. At some point, while researchers work on figuring out where the truth lies, it just makes sense to say the potential benefit outweighs the cost.
The best evidence to date concerns folate, one of the B vitamins. It’s been proved to limit the number of defects in embryos (胚胎), and a recent trial found that folate in combination with vitamin B 12 and a form of B6 also decreases the re-blockage of arteries after surgical repair.
The news on vitamin E has been more mixed. Healthy folks who take 400 international units daily for at least two years appear somewhat less likely to develop heart disease. But when doctors give vitamin E to patients who already have he art disease, the vitamin doesn’t seem to help. It may turn out that vitamin E plays a role in prevention but cannot undo serious damage.
Despite vitamin C’s great popularity, consuming large amounts of it still has not been positively linked to any great benefit. The body quickly becomes saturated with C and simply excretes (排泄) any excess.
The multivitamins question boils down to this: Do you need to wait until all the evidence is in before you take them, or are you willing to accept that there’s enough evidence that they don’t hurt and could help?
If the latter, there’s no need to go to extremes and buy the biggest horse pills or the most expensive bottles. Large doses can cause trouble, including excessive bleeding and nervous system problems.
Multivitamins are no substitute for exercise and a balanced diet, of course.
As long as you understand that any potential benefit is modest and subject to further refinement, taking a daily multivitamin makes a lot of sense.
21. At one time doctors discouraged taking multivitamins because they believed that multivitamins ________.
A) could not easily be absorbed by the human body
B) were potentially harmful to people’s health
C) were too expensive for daily consumption
D) could not provide any cure for vitamin deficiencies
22. According to the author, clinical trials of vitamin supplements ________.
A) often result in misleading conclusions
B) take time and will not produce conclusive results
C) should be conducted by scientists on a larger scale
D) appear to be a sheer waste of time and resources
23. It has been found that vitamin E ________.
A) should be taken by patients regularly and persistently
B) can effectively reduce the recurrence of heart disease
C) has a preventive but not curative effect on heart disease
D) should be given to patients with heart disease as early as possible
24. It can be seen that large doses of multivitamins ________.
A) may bring about serious side effects
B) may help prevent excessive bleeding
C) are likely to induce the blockage of arteries
D) are advisable for those with vitamin deficiencies
25. The author concludes the passage with the advice that ________.
A) the benefit of daily multivitamin intake outweighs that of exercise and a balanced diet
B) it’s risky to take multivitamins without knowing their specific function
C) the potential benefit of multivitamins can never be overestimated
D) it’s reasonable to take a rational dose of multivitamins daily
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Some futurologists have assumed that the vast upsurge (剧增) of women in the workforce may portend a rejection of marriage. Many women, according to this hypothesis, would rather work than marry. The converse (反面) of this concern is that the prospects of becoming a multi-paycheck household could encourage marriages. In the past, only the earnings and financial prospects of the man counted in the marriage decision. Now, however, the earning ability of a woman can make her more attractive as a marriage partner. Data show that economic downturns tend to postpone marriage because the parties cannot afford to establish a family or are concerned about rainy days ahead. As the economy rebounds, the number of marriages also rises.
Coincident with the increase in women working outside the home is the increase in divorce rates. Yet, it may be wrong to jump to any simple cause-and-effect conclusions. The impact of a wife’s work on divorce is no less cloudy than its impact on marriage decisions. The realization that she can be a good provider may increase the chances that a working wife will choose divorce over an unsatisfactory marriage. But the reverse is equally plausible. Tensions grounded in financial problems often play a key role in ending a marriage. Given high unemployment, inflationary problems, and slow growth in real earnings, a working wife can increase household income and relieve some of these pressing financial burdens. By raising a family’s standard of living, a working wife may strengthen her family’s financial and emotional stability.
Psychological factors also should be considered. For example, a wife blocked from a career outside the home may feel caged in the house. She may view her only choice as seeking a divorce.
On the other hand, if she can find fulfillment through work outside the home, work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union.
Also, a major part of women’s inequality in marriage has been due to the fact that, in most cases, men have remained the main breadwinners. With higher earning capacity and status occupations outside of the home comes the capacity to exercise power within the family. A working wife may rob a husband of being the master of the house. Depending upon how the couple reacts to these new conditions, it could create a stronger equal partnership or it could create new insecurities.
26. The word “portend” (Line 2, Para. 1) is closest in meaning to “________”.
A) defy
B) signal
C) suffer from
D) result from
27. It is said in the passage that when the economy slides, ________.
A) men would choose working women as their marriage partners
B) more women would get married to seek financial security
C) even working women would worry about their marriages
D) more people would prefer to remain single for the time being
28. If women find fulfillment through work outside the home, ________.
A) they are more likely to dominate their marriage partners
B) their husbands are expected to do more housework
C) their marriage ties can be strengthened
D) they tend to put their career before marriage
29. One reason why women with no career may seek a divorce is that ________.
A) they feel that they have been robbed of their freedom
B) they are afraid of being bossed around by their husbands
C) they feel that their partners fail to live up to their expectations
D) they tend to suspect their husbands’ loyalty to their marriage
30. Which of the following statements can best summarize the author’s view in the passage?
A) The stability of marriage and the divorce rate may reflect the economic situation of the country.
B) Even when economically independent, most women have to struggle for real equality in marriage.
C) In order to secure their marriage women should work outside the home and remain independent.
D) The impact of the growing female workforce on marriage varies from case to case.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
For most thinkers since the Greek philosophers, it was self-evident that the re is something called human nature, something that constitutes the essence of man. There were various views about what constitutes it, but there was agreement that such an essence exists―that is to say, that there is something by virtue of which man is man. Thus man was defined as a rational being, as a social animal, an animal that can make tools, or a symbol-making animal.
More recently, this traditional view has begun to be questioned. One reason for this change was the increasing emphasis given to the historical approach to man. An examination of the history of humanity suggested that man in our epoch is so different from man in previous times that it seemed unrealistic to assume that men in every age have had in common something that can be called “human nature.” The historical approach was reinforced, particularly in the United States, by studies in the field of cultural anthropology (人类学). The study of primitive peoples has discovered such a diversity of customs, values, feelings, and thoughts that many anthropologists arrived at the concept that man is born as a blank sheet of paper on which each culture writes its text. Another factor contributing to the tendency to deny the assumption of a fixed human nature was that the concept has so often been abused as a shield behind which the most inhuman acts are committed. In the name of human nature, for example, Aristotle and most thinkers up to the eighteenth century defended slavery. Or in order to prove the rationality and necessity of the capitalist form of society, scholars have tried to make a case for acquisitiveness, competitiveness, and selfishness as innate (天生的) human traits. Popularly, one refers cynically to “human nature” in accepting the inevitability of such undesirable human behavior as greed, murder, cheating and lying.
Another reason for skepticism about the concept of human nature probably lies in the influence of evolutionary thinking. Once man came to be seen as developing in the process of evolution, the idea of a substance which is contained in his essence seemed untenable. Yet I believe it is precisely from an evolutionary standpoint that we can expect new insight into the problem of the nature of man.
31. The traditional view of “human nature” was strongly challenged by ________.
A) the emergence of the evolutionary theory
B) the historical approach to man
C) new insight into human behavior
D) the philosophical analysis of slavery
32. According to the passage, anthropologists believe that human beings ________.
A) have some traits in common
B) are born with diverse cultures
C) are born without a fixed nature
D) change their characters as they grow up
33. The author mentioned Aristotle, a great ancient thinker, in order to ________.
A) emphasize that he contributed a lot to defining the concept of “human nature”
B) show that the concept of “human nature” was used to justify social evils
C) prove that he had a profound influence on the concept of “human nature”
D) support the idea that some human traits are acquired
34. The word “untenable” (Line 3) in the last paragraph of the passage most probably means ________.
A) invaluable
B) imaginable
C) changeable
D) indefensible
35. Most philosophers believed that human nature ________.
A) is the quality distinguishing man from other animals
B) consists of competitiveness and selfishness
C) is something partly innate and partly acquired
D) consists of rationality and undesirable behavior
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Richard Satava, program manager for advanced medical technologies, has been a driving force in bringing virtual reality to medicine, where computers create a “virtual” or simulated environment for surgeons and other medical practitioners (从业者).
“With virtual reality we’ll be able to put a surgeon in every trench,” said Satava. He envisaged a time when soldiers who are wounded fighting overseas are put in mobile surgical units equipped with computers.
The computers would transmit images of the soldiers to surgeons back in the U.S. The surgeons would look at the soldier through virtual reality helmets (头盔) that contain a small screen displaying the image of the wound. The doctors would guide robotic instruments in the battlefield mobile surgical unit that operate on the soldier.
Although Satava’s vision may be years away from standard operating procedure, scientists are progressing toward virtual reality surgery. Engineers at an international organization in California are developing a tele-operating device. As surgeons watch a three-dimensional image of the surgery, they move instruments that are connected to a computer, which passes their movements to robotic instruments that perform the surgery. The computer provides feedback to the surgeon on force, textures, and sound.
These technological wonders may not yet be part of the community hospital setting but increasingly some of the machinery is finding its way into civilian medicine. At Wayne State University Medical School, surgeon Lucia Zamorano takes images of the brain from computerized scans and uses a computer program to produce a 3-D image. She can then maneuver the 3-D image on the computer screen to map the shortest, least invasive surgical path to the tumor (肿瘤). Zamorano is also using technology that attaches a probe to surgical instruments so that she can track their positions. While cutting away a tumor deep in the brain, she watches the movement of her surgical tools in a computer graphics image of the patient’s brain taken before surgery.
During these procedures―operations that are done through small cuts in the body in which a miniature camera and surgical tools are maneuvered―surgeons are wearing 3-D glasses for a better view. And they are commanding robot surgeons to cut away tissue more accurately than human surgeons can.
Satava says, “We are in the midst of a fundamental change in the field of medicine.”
36. According to Richard Satava, the application of virtual reality to medicine ________.
A) will enable surgeons to be physically present on every battlefield
B) can raise the spirits of soldiers wounded on the battlefield
C) will greatly improve medical conditions on the battlefield
D) can shorten the time for operations on soldiers wounded on the battlefield
37. Richard Satava has visions of ________.
A) using a remote-control technique to treat wounded soldiers fighting overseas
B) wounded soldiers being saved by doctors wearing virtual reality helmets on the battlefield
C) wounded soldiers being operated on by specially trained surgeons
D) setting up mobile surgical units overseas
38. How is virtual reality surgery performed?
A) It is performed by a computer-designed high precision device.
B) Surgeons wear virtual reality helmets to receive feedback provided by a computer.
C) Surgeons move robotic instruments by means of a computer linked to them.
D) A 3-D image records the movements of the surgeons during the operation.
39. During virtual reality operations, the surgeon can have a better view of the cuts in the body because ________.
A) he is looking at the cuts on a computer screen
B) the cuts can be examined from different angles
C) the cuts have been highly magnified

Thomas Malthus published his “Essay on the Principle of Population” almost 200 years ago. Ever since then, forecasters have being warning that worldwide famine was (S1) just around the next corner. The fast-growing population’s demand for food, they warned, would soon exceed their (S2) supply, leading to widespread food shortages and starvation.
But in reality, the world’s total grain harvest has risen steadily over the years. Except for relative isolated trouble (S3) spots like present-day Somalia, and occasional years of good harvests, the world’s food crisis has remained just (S4) around the corner. Most experts believe this can continue even as if the population doubles by the mid-21st century, (S5) although feeding 10 billion people will not be easy for politics, economic and environmental reasons. Optimists (S6) point to concrete examples of continued improvements in yield. In Africa, by instance, improved seed, more (S7) fertilizer and advanced growing practices have more than double corn and wheat yields in an experiment. Elsewhere, (S8) rice experts in the Philippines are producing a plant with few (S9) stems and more seeds. There is no guarantee that plant breeders can continue to develop new, higher-yielding crop, but most researchers see their success to date as reason (S10) for hope.

Passage One
【短文大意】 本文介绍了维生素的作用。越来越多研究表明即使少量的维生素缺乏也会有损身体健康。尽管关于维生素好处的证据还不是很充分，但花钱买维生素是很划算的。健康人至少连续两年每天吃400单位维生素E就不大可能患心脏病。但心脏病患者再吃维生素E却于事无补。维生素E的作用主要是预防而不是治疗疾病。但过量服用维生素也会引起麻烦。
21. A。本题为事实推断题。依据首段第一句话就可推断出以前的医生对服用复合维生素不以为然，因为他们认为维生素不能被人体吸收―从小便中排出体外。所以A为正确选项。
22. B。细节推断题。其答题依据为第二段第二句话。有关维生素的实验研究往往费时而且引起更多的疑问，言外之意此实验研究的结果没有定论。故B为正确答案。
23. C。事实判断题。其答题依据为第四段，尤其是该段最后一句。维生素E有预防心脏病的功效但不能治好心脏病。故C 正确。B为干扰项，服用维生素E只是不太可能患心脏病，并不是有效减少心脏病的复发率，所以B不对。
24. A。细节判断题。答题依据为第七段第二句话。大剂量服用维生素会引起大出血、神经系统的毛病及其它副作用。故A为正确答案。
25. D。作者观点推断题。答题依据为最后一段。维生素不能代替运动和均衡的饮食。只要人们对维生素的好处不盲从，那每天适量服用它就很有益处。故D 为正确答案。
Passage Two
【短文大意】本文介绍了关于职业女性与婚姻的两种观点。有些未来学家认为随着女性劳动力人数的急剧增长，许多女性会选择不结婚。与此相反，另一种观点认为职业女性的增加会使结婚的人数也增加。作者显然赞成后一种观点。职业女性能提高家庭的收入和生活标准，因此有助于家庭情感的稳固。从心理因素考虑，职业女性在工作上的成就感也有利于家庭关系的稳定。女性成为家庭经济收入的主力军能提高她们在家里的地位，并有里利于婚姻中男女的平等。
26. B。词汇猜意考查题。portend v. 预示，预兆;根据第一段第一句的句意可推断正确答案为B.
27. D。细节判断题。答题依据为第一段倒数底二句话。数据表明在经济衰退时，许多人因为无法负担组建家庭或因为对未来的困难没有把握而不结婚。故D为正确答案。
28. C。事实判断题。答题依据为第三段最后一句话。女性在工作上的成就感有利于婚姻关系的稳定。故C为正确答案。
29. A。细节推断题。答题依据为第三段第二句话。女性没有工作会有被囚禁在家的感受，她会选择离婚作为解救自己的唯一出路。故A为正确答案。
30. D。文章主旨判断题。整段文章的主旨可从最后一句话看出。故D为正确答案。
Passage Three
【短文大意】本文介绍了对普遍人性观点的三种挑战。大多数哲学家认为人性将人与动物区分开来，人性使人成为理性的存在。但近来由于三种新的观点，这种传统观点受到质疑。第一种新视角就是历史研究方法。该方法认为远古人与现代人相去甚远。美国人类学家的研究也赞成历史研究方法，人类学家认为人类生下来就像一张白纸等待文化的涂写。第二种新视角认为所谓“人性”的说法不过是为人类非人道的行为做掩护，如亚里士多德利用“人性”为奴隶制作辩护。第三种挑战来自于进化论。一旦人被视为处于不断进化的过程当中，普遍人性的观点自然就站不住脚。
31. B。纵观全文得出对普遍人性这一看法的挑战主要来自历史研究观点。而题干是问对“人性”的挑战主要来自何种观点。故B为正确答案。
32. C。细节判断题。答题依据为第二段第四句。对远古民族的研究揭示了人类风俗、价值观、感情和思想的多样性，因此许多考古学家认为人类出生时像一张白纸，真正起决定作用的是文化。言外之意没有固定不变的人性。故C为正确答案。
33. B。事实判断题。答题依据为第二段第五句。作者以亚里士多德为例说明有些哲学家用“人性”的名义作为掩护人类罪恶的幌子。故B为正确答案。
34. D。词汇猜意考查题。untenable adj. 站不住脚的，无法辩护的。根据本句上下文可知正确答案为D.
35. A。细节题。答案可从第一段看出。

36. C。细节判断题。答题依据为第一段和二段。将虚拟技术运用到外科手术中能每个战壕都有一个外科医生，即海外战场的医疗条件能大大提高。故C为正确答案。
37. A。细节推断题。答案依据第三段。故A为正确答案。
38. C。细节推断题。答题依据为第四段最后两句话。虚拟手术的过程外科医生通过观察伤口的三维画面，他们操作与电脑联网的仪器，电脑将他们的动作传递给机器人医生来操刀外科手术。故C为正确答案。

40. D。事实判断题。答题依据为倒数第二段最后一句话。外科医生指挥机器人外科医生切除坏的组织，机器人比真人外科医生更精确地操刀动手术。故D为正确答案。

74. good → poor/bad句首用了Except for,显然是指不好的事情，故这里应将good 改为bad或poor.

Nowadays, waste is quite prevalent and serious on campus. Food is thrown away simply because it doesn’t taste good. Newspapers and magazines are discarded, because they have been read. What is worse, students seem to be quite accustomed to such waste and don’t have a feeling of guilt.
Waste can do much harm. Our country has the largest population in the world and suffers from a shortage of natural resources. It is crucial for us to make full use of what we have, or else, the resources will soon run out, and we will have nothing left for the next generations. Waste is certainly making matters worse.
Second, waste may contribute to a habit of extravagance, which is not good at all. We Chinese people have the good tradition of being economic, and are indignant about waste of any kind.
Therefore, all of us should reduce waste. We can try to eat up a meal. We may give our old books to those who need them, instead of throwing them away. Also, we should form the notion that waste is quite shameful. As long as all of us take action, waste will surely be reduced.

Passage One
The Golden Gate Bridge joins the beautiful city of San Francisco with the suburbs to the north. Each day about one hundred thousand automobiles cross the bridge taking people to and from the city. More than half of them cross the bridge during the morning and evening rush hours. When traffic is so heavy the trip is not pleasant. Now, however, there is at least one group of happy commuters. These are the people who travel under the bridge instead of on it. They go to work by boat and enjoy it so much that most of them say they will never go by car again. The ferry they take is spacious, quiet and comfortable. Commuters can enjoy the sun on deck. In the morning they can have breakfast in the coffee shop. And in the evening they can order a drink in the bar while looking at the beautiful scenery. The trip takes only 30 minutes and is not very costly. Best of all, being on a boat seems to make people more friendly toward each other. There has already been a marriage of two commuters who met on the ferry. Because the ferry has been so successful, there are plans to use other still larger boats. The re is also a proposal for a high speed boat that will make the trip in only 15 minutes. But not everyone is happy about that. A lot of people feel that half an hour is just enough time to relax.
11. According to the speaker how do commuters feel about crossing the Golden Gate Bridge by car?
12. What does the speaker say about ferry commuters?
13. How do commuters respond to plans for the future of the ferry?
Passage Two
How many teeth have you had filled in the past two years? If you follow the adv ice of Dr. Faustick, you may be able to reduce the number of your visits to a dentist. Dr. Faustick conducted a two-year survey to find out how to prevent or re duce dental decay. 946 students took part in an experiment. 523 students cleaned their teeth within ten minutes of eating: when possible they used a toothbrush, when this was impossible they washed their mouth thoroughly with water. The remaining 423 students merely cleaned their teeth when they went to bed and when they got up in the morning. All the students had their teeth X-rayed at the end of the first and second years. At the end of the first year, the night and morning group had three times as many decayed teeth as the clean after each meal group. At the end of the second year the latter group had 53 percent fewer decayed teeth than the former group. Dr. Faustick has cleaned his teeth after meal for thirteen years and has not had a single decayed tooth. He pointed out that sugar is a major agent in dental decay. Particularly the sugar in sweets, cakes, and soft drinks. Ideally you should keep a tooth brush in your pocket and use it immediately after you have finished eating. When this is impractical you can at least make sure that you have a drink of water and let the water through your teeth to force out any particles of food. 7 out of 10 people loose at least ha lf of their teeth by the time they are fifty. Many have a complete set of false teeth by that time. In any case neither toothache nor a visit to a dentist is very pleasant. So it is worthwhile making an effort to keep you own teeth as long as possible. The main preventative agent is simply water.
14. According to the passage what kind of food is most likely to cause dental decay?
15. What does the passage tell us about the condition of Dr. Faustick’s teeth?
16. What does Dr. Faustick suggest to prevent dental decay?
Passage Three
The worldwide Organization of the Red Cross stems from the ideal of Henri Dunant, a Swiss Banker. In 1838, at the age of ten, Dunant was taken by his father to visit a prison, there he saw prisoners chained together exercising in the yard and breaking stones along the road. This experience left a deep impression on him and made him determined to do something for convicts and slaves and for all who were oppressed and deprived of their liberty. On 24th June 1859 while on his way from Geneva to France, Dunant witnessed the battle between the French and Austrian armies. It was one of the fiercest battles of the 19th century. Shocked by the lack of medical supplies and attention given to the wounded, Dunant decided that a volunteer service had to be organized. He gathered together a number of women who attended to the hundreds of wounded soldiers of all nationalities and helped the surgeons as best they could. From that battle Dunant determined to form a body of people who would rally together in times of war and attend to the needs of wounded and dying. Dunant held that a suffering human being should be helped for his own sake only and without regard to race, religion, or political beliefs. Many European states supported him and on 22nd August 1864 the first Geneva Convention was signed. This lays down that once a soldier is wounded he and everyone else who comes to his help ceases to be an enemy. A symbol by which the relief workers could be recognized was devised. As a tribute to Switzerland, the symbol was the Swiss flag reversed. That is a red cross on a white ground. So the Red Cross was born.
17. What first led Henri Dunant to think of helping the oppressed?
18. What did Henri Dunant do during the battle between the French and Austrian armies?
19. What was Henri Dunant’s belief when he founded the Red Cross?
20. Why was the symbol of the Red Cross designed with a red cross on a white ground?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There tire 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the, Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Given the lack of fit between gifted students and their schools, it is not surprising that such students often have little good to say ‘about their school experience. In one study of 400 adults who had achieved distinction in all areas of life, researchers found that three-fifths of these individuals either did badly in school or were unhappy in school. Few MacArthur Prize fellows, winners of the MacArthur Award for creative accomplishment, had good things to say about their precollegiate schooling if they had not been placed in advanced programs. Anecdotal (名人轶事) reports support this. Pablo Picasso, Charles Darwin, Mark Twain, Oliver Goldsmith, and William Butler Yeats all disliked school. So did Winston Churchill, who almost failed out of Harrow, an elite British school. About Oliver Goldsmith, one of his teachers remarked, “Never was so dull a boy.” Often these children realize that they know more than their teachers, and their teachers often feel that these children are arrogant, inattentive, or unmotivated.
Some of these gifted people may have done poorly in school because their gifts were not scholastic. Maybe we can account for Picasso in this way. But most fared poorly in school not because they lacked ability but because they found school unchallenging and consequently lost interest. Yeats described the lack of fit between his mind and school: “Because I had found it difficult to attend to anything less interesting than my own thoughts, I was difficult to teach.” As noted earlier, gifted children of all kinds tend to be strong-willed nonconformists. Nonconformity and stubbornness (and Yeats’s level of arrogance and self-absorption) are likely to lead to Conflicts with teachers.
When highly gifted students in any domain talk about what was important to the development of their abilities, they are far more likely to mention their families than their schools or teachers. A writing prodigy (神童) studied by David Feldman and Lynn Goldsmith was taught far more about writing by his journalist father than his English teacher. High-IQ children, in Australia studied by Miraca Gross had much more positive feelings about their families than their schools. About half of the mathematicians studied by Benjamin Bloom had little good to say about school. They all did well in school and took honors classes when available, and some skipped grades.
21. The main point the author is making about schools is that ________.
A) they should enroll as many gifted students as possible
B) they should organize their classes according to the students’ ability
C) they are often incapable of catering to the needs of talented students
D) they should satisfy the needs of students from different family backgrounds
22. The author quotes the remarks of one of Oliver Goldsmith’s teachers ________.
A) to show how poor Oliver’s performance was at school
B) to illustrate the strong will of some gifted children
C) to explain how dull students can also be successful
D) to provide support for his argument
23. Pablo Picasso is listed among the many gifted children who ________.
A) could not cope with their studies at school successfully
B) paid no attention to their teachers in class
C) contradicted their teachers much too often
D) behaved arrogantly and stubbornly in the presence of their teachers
24. Many gifted people attributed their success ________.
A) less to their systematic education than to their talent
B) mainly to parental help and their education at home
C) both to school instruction and to their parents’ coaching
D) more to their parents’ encouragement than to school training
25. The root cause of many gifted students having bad memories of their school years is that ________.
A) they were seldom praised by their teachers
B) school courses failed to inspire or motivate them
C) their nonconformity brought them a lot of trouble
D) teachers were usually far stricter than their parents
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
It’s hardly news that the immigration system is a mess. Foreign nationals have long been slipping across the border with fake papers, and visitors who arrive in the U.S. legitimately often overstay their legal welcome without being punished. But since Sept. 11, it’s become clear that terrorists have been shrewdly factoring the weaknesses of our system into their plans. In addition to their mastery of forging passports, at least three of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers (劫机者) were here on expired visas. That’s been a safe bet until now. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) (移民归化局) lacks the resources, and apparently the inclination, to keep track of the estimated 2 million foreigners who have intentionally overstayed their welcome.
But this laxness (马虎) toward immigration fraud may be about to change. Congress has already taken some modest steps. The U.S.A. Patriot Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 tragedy, requires the FBI, the Justice Department, the State Department and the INS to share more data, which will make it easier to stop watch-listed terrorists at the border.
But what’s really needed, critics say, is even tougher laws and more resources aimed at tightening up border security. Reformers are calling for a rollback of rules that hinder law enforcement. They also want the INS to hire hundreds more border patrol agents and investigators to keep illegal immigrants out and to track them down once they’re here. Reformers also want to see the INS set up a database to monitor whether visa holders actually leave the country when they are required to.
All these proposed changes were part of a new border-security bill that passed the House of Representatives but died in the Senate last week. Before Sept. 11, legislation of this kind had been blocked by two powerful lobbies: universities, which rely on tuition from foreign students who could be kept out by the new law, and business, which relies on foreigners for cheap labor. Since the attacks, they’ve backed off. The bill would have passed this time but for congressional maneuverings and is expected to be reintroduced and to pass next year.
Also on the agenda for next year: a proposal, backed by some influential law-makers, to split the INS into two agencies-a good cop that would tend to service functions like processing citizenship papers and a bad cop that would concentrate on border inspections, deportation and other functions. One reason for the division, supporters say, is that the INS has in recent years become too focused on serving tourists and immigrants. After the Sept, 11 tragedy, the INS should pay more attention to serving the millions of ordinary Americans who rely on the nation’s border security to protect them from terrorist attacks.
26. Terrorists have obviously taken advantage of ________.
A) the irresponsibility of the officials at border checkpoints
B) the legal privileges granted to foreigners
C) the excessive hospitality of the American people
D) the low efficiency of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
27. We learn from the passage that coordinated efforts will be made by various U.S. government agencies to ________.
A) limit the number Of immigrants to the U.S.
B) prevent the forgery of immigration papers
C) ward off terrorist suspects at the border
D) refuse the renewing of expired visas
28. It can be inferred from the passage that before Sept. 11, aliens with expired visas ________.
A) might stay on for as long as [hey wished
B) would be closely watched by FBI agents
C) would live in constant fear of deportation
D) might have them extended without trouble
29. It is believed by many that all these years the INS ________.
A) has been serving two contradictory functions
B) has ignored the pleas of the two powerful lobbies
C) has over-emphasized its service functions at the expense of the nation’s security
D) has been too liberal in granting visas to tourists and immigrants indiscriminately
30. Before Sept. 11, the U.S. Congress had been unable to pass stricter immigration laws because ________.
A) education and business circles cared little about national security
B) resources were not available for their enforcement
C) it was difficult to coordinate the efforts of the congressmen
D) they might have kept away foreign students and cheap labor
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
It was the worst tragedy in maritime (航海的) history, six times more deadly than the Titanic. When the German cruise ship Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by torpedoes (鱼雷) fired from a Russian submarine in the final winter of World War II, more than 10,000 people-mostly women, children and old people fleeing the final Red Army push into Nazi Germany-were packed aboard. An ice storm had turned the decks into frozen sheets that sent hundreds of families sliding into the sea as the ship tilted and began to go down. Others desperately tried to put lifeboats down. Some who succeeded fought off those in the water who had the strength to try to claw their way aboard. Most people froze immediately. I’ll never forget the screams,” says Christa Ntitzmann, 87, one of the 1,200 survivors. She recalls watching the ship, brightly lit, slipping into its dark grave-and into seeming nothingness, rarely mentioned for more than half a century.
Now Germany’s Nobel Prize-winning author Gtinter Grass has revived the memory of the 9,000 dead, including more than 4,000 children-with his latest novel Crab Walk, published last month. The book, which will be out in English next year, doesn’t dwell on the sinking; its heroine is a pregnant young woman who survives the catastrophe only to say later: “Nobody wanted to hear about it, not here in the West (of Germany) and not at all in the East.” The reason was obvious. As Grass put it in a recent interview with the weekly Die Woche: “Because the crimes we Germans are responsible for were and are so dominant, we didn’t have the energy left to tell of our own sufferings.”
The long silence about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was probably unavoidable-and necessary. By unreservedly owning up to their country’s monstrous crimes in the Second World War, Germans have managed to win acceptance abroad, marginalize (使…不得势) the neo-Nazis at home and make peace with their neighbors. Today’s unified Germany is more prosperous and stable than at any time in its long, troubled history. For that, a half century of willful forgetting about painful memories like the German Titanic was perhaps a reasonable price to pay. But even the most politically correct Germans believe that they’ ye now earned the right to discuss the full historical record. Not to equate German suffering with that of its victims, but simply to acknowledge a terrible tragedy.
31. Why does the author say the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was the worst tragedy in maritime history?
A) It was attacked by Russian torpedoes.
B) It caused the largest number of casualties.
C) Most of its passengers were frozen to death.
D) Its victims were mostly women and children.
32. Hundreds of families dropped into the sea when ________.
A) the badly damaged ship leaned toward one side
B) a strong ice storm tilted the ship
C) the cruise ship sank all of a sudden
D) the frightened passengers fought desperately for lifeboats
33. The Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy was little talked about for more than half a century because Germans ________.
A) were eager to win international acceptance
B) had been pressured to keep silent about it
C) were afraid of offending their neighbors
D) felt guilty for their crimes in World War II
34. How does Gunter Grass revive the memory of the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy?
A) By describing the ship’s sinking in great detail.
B) By giving an interview to the weekly Die Woche.
C) By presenting the horrible scene of the torpedo attack.
D) By depicting the survival of a young pregnant woman.
35. It can be learned from the passage that Germans no longer think that ________.
A) the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy is a reasonable price to pay for the nation’s past misdeeds
B) Germany is responsible for the horrible crimes it committed in World War II
C) they will be misunderstood if they talk about the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy
D) it-is wrong to equate their sufferings with those of other countries
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
When we worry about who might be spying on our private lives, we usually think about the Federal agents. But the private sector outdoes the government every time. It’s Linda Tripp, not the FBI, who is facing charges under Maryland’s laws against secret telephone taping. It’s our banks, not the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that pass our private financial data to telemarketing firms.
Consumer activists are pressing Congress for better privacy laws without much result so far. The legislators lean toward letting business people track our financial habits virtually at will.
As an example of what’s going on, consider U.S. Bancorp, which was recently sued for deceptive practices by the state of Minnesota. According to the lawsuit, the bank supplied a telemarketer called Member Works with sensitive customer data such as names, phone numbers, bank-account and credit-card numbers, Social Security numbers, account balances and credit limits.
With these customer lists in hand, Member Works started dialing for dollars-selling dental plans, videogames, computer software and other products and services. Customers who accepted a “free trial offer” had 30 days to cancel. If the deadline passed, they were charged automatically through their bank or credit-card accounts. U.S. Bancorp collected a share of the revenues.
Customers were doubly deceived, the lawsuit claims. They, didn’t know that the bank was giving account numbers to MemberWorks. And if customers asked, they were led to think the answer was no.
The state sued MemberWorks separately for deceptive selling. The company denies that it did anything wrong. For its part, U.S. Bancorp settled without admitting any mistakes. But it agreed to stop exposing its customers to nonfinancial products sold by outside firms. A few top banks decided to do the same. Many other banks will still do business with MemberWorks and similar firms.
And banks will still be mining data from your account in order to sell you financial products, including things of little value, such as credit insurance and credit-card protection plans.
You have almost no protection from businesses that use your personal accounts for profit. For example, no federal law shields “transaction and experience” information-mainly the details of your bank and credit-card accounts. Social Security numbers are for sale by private firms. They’ve generally agreed not to sell to the public. But to businesses, the numbers are an open book. Self-regulation doesn’t work. A firm might publish a privacy-protection policy, but who enforces it?
Take U.S. Bancorp again. Customers were told, in writing, that “all personal information you supply to us will be considered confidential.” Then it sold your data to MemberWorks. The bank even claims that it doesn’t “sell” your data at all. It merely “shares” it and reaps a profit. Now you know.
36. Contrary to popular belief, the author finds that spying on people’s privacy ________.
A) is practiced exclusively by the FBI
B) is more prevalent in business circles
C) has been intensified with the help of the IRS
D) is mainly carried out by means of secret taping
37. We know from the passage that ________.
A) the state of Minnesota is considering drawing up laws to protect private information
B) most states are turning a blind eye to the deceptive practices of private businesses
C) legislators are acting to pass a law to provide better privacy protection
D) lawmakers are inclined to give a free hand to businesses to inquire into customers’ buying habits
38. When the “free trial” deadline is over, you’ll be charged without notice for a product or service if ________.
A) you happen to reveal your credit card number
B) you fail to cancel it within the specified period
C) you fail to apply for extension of the deadline
D) you find the product or service unsatisfactory
39. Businesses do not regard information concerning personal bank accounts as private because ________.
A) it is considered “transaction and experience” information unprotected by law
B) it has always been considered an open secret by the general public
C) its sale can be brought under control through self-regulation
D) its revelation will do no harm to consumers under the current protection policy
40. We can infer from the passage that ________.
A) banks will have to change their ways of doing business
B) “free trial” practice will eventually be banned

Part IV Error Correction (15 minutes)
Directions: This part consists of a short passage. In this passage, there are altogether 10 mistakes, one in each numbered line. You may have to change a word, add a word or delete a word. Mark out the mistakes and put the corrections in the blanks provided. If you change a word, cross it out and write the correct word in the corresponding blank. If you add a word, put an insertion mark (∧) in the right place and write the missing word in the blank. If you delete a word, cross it and put a slash (/) in the blank.
Example:
Culture refers to the social heritage of a people―the learned patterns for thinking, feeling and acting that characterize a population or society, include the expression of these patters in (S1) material things. Culture is compose of nonmaterial culture―(S2) abstract creations like values, beliefs, customs and institutional arrangements―and material culture―physical object like (S3) cooking pots, computers and bathtubs. In sum, culture reflects both the ideas we share or everything we make. In ordinary (S4) speech, a person of culture is the individual can speak another (S5) language―the person who is unfamiliar with the arts, music, (S6) literature, philosophy, or history. But to sociologists, to be human is to be cultured, because of culture is the common world (S7) of experience we share with other members of our group.
Culture is essentially to our humanness. It provides a kind (S8) of map for relating to others. Consider how you feel your way about social life. How do you know how to act in a classroom, or a department store, or toward a person who smiles or laugh (S9) at you? Your culture supplies you by broad, standardized, (S10) ready-made answers for dealing with each of these situations.
Therefore, if we know a person’s culture, we can understand and even predict a good deal of his behavior.

[参考范文]
June 19, 2004
Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to reflect some problems I came across recently and, appeal to the improvement of the service industry.
This weekend I bought an English-Chinese dictionary in a bookstore near my home since its cover is elaborately designed. But when I went home and read carefully, I found that the several pages of the dictionary have been cracked and befouled. What is worse, the misprints spread everywhere in the dictionary and seriously affect my comprehension. Since there was such damage and misprint to the dictionary, I went to the bookstore to require for a replace. But to my surprise, the staff of the bookstore turn down my request rudely and even denied the poor quality of the dictionary.
It goes without saying that today’s face-paced and market-oriented economy calls for much higher standard for service industry. However, to my regret, many of the commercials fail to achieve this standard and the quality of the staff needs to be improved. It’s self-evident that the poor quality of practitioners in the service industry will not only deeply disappoint customers but also hamper the development of our country’s economy. As a result, I expect your newspaper to appeal to the service industry to attach more importance to the service improvement.
Thank you for your attention!
Sincerely yours,
Sam

听力原文
1. W: Oh, Dick. You are wearing a black jacket but yellow trousers. It’s the strangest combination I’ve ever seen.
M: I know. I got up late and dressed in a hurry. I didn’t realize my mistake until I entered the office.
Q: What does the woman think of the way Dick dressed?
2. M: Excuse me. But has anyone turned in a brown leather wallet? I’ve lost my wallet. It contains my driver’s license and also some family pictures that are pretty important to me.
W: Oh, yes. We had a wallet brought in this morning. Wait here just a minute, please.
Q: What would the woman probably do?
3. M: Excuse me, Madam. Is the air-conditioning on? This room is as hot as a furnace.
W: Sorry, sir. A new epidemic called SARS is threatening us right now. As a preventative measure, we are told to let in fresh air by opening the windows and not to use the air conditioners.
Q: What does the woman mean?
4. M: You look quite different from what you used to.
W: Sure. I started exercising regularly two years ago and went from 253 pounds to a healthy 160 pounds and that is the only thing I did not give up halfway.
Q: What do we know about woman?
5. M: I wonder if you find my experience relevant to the job.
W: Yes, certainly. But if only you had sent your application letter a week earlier.
Q: What does the woman imply?
6. W: Shouldn’t someone go pick up the clothes form the laundry? They were ready three hours ago.
M: Don’t look at me, mom.
Q: What does the boy mean?
7. M: Er... Hi, could you tell me where electronic products are displayed? I want to see some TVs, digital video cameras, DVD players, that sort of thing.
W: Well. Several countries are displaying electronic products. China’s selection is very large this year. You might as well go to the east wing first to take a look at a Chinese booth.
Q: Where is the conversation most probably taking place?
8. M: Well, what did you think of the movie?
W: I don’t know why I let you talk me into going. I just don’t like violence. Next time you’d better choose a comedy.
Q: What can we infer from the conversation?
9. W: Who do you think should get the job? How about Mr. Becket?
M: Mr. Becket? I’m not sure. He is a nice fellow, of course, and easy to get along with. But I doubt his professional expertise. I want someone who can get the job done.
Q: What do we learn from the conversation about Mr. Becket?
10. M: Do you think home video players will replace movie theatres and force them out of the entertainment business?
W: We’re certainly faced with the grave challenge from the DVD industry. That’s why I think we have to revolutionize our concept of movie showing. As I see it, the movie theatre should not just be a place to watch a film, but a place to meet people.
Q: What does the woman think of the movie theatre?
Passage One
Few people can stand for the spirit of earlier America as much as Benjamin Franklin. He lived through almost the whole of the 18th century. He was born six years after the century began, and died ten years before it ended. During this time, he saw the American colonies grow from tiny settlements into a nation and he also contributed much to the new state. He was deeply interested in science and natural history and his experiments with electricity and lightning led directly to the invention of the lightning rod. He was also interested in improving the conditions of his fellow men. He was involved in a number of projects in his native Philadelphia, including the setting up of a library, and a university, a philosophical society and fire-prevention service. He worked hard to enable the American colonies to gain independence from Britain. As ambassador to France, he encouraged the French to help George Washington. After the war, he attended the American Constitutional Congress. This was his last contribution, for he died late that year. He is still fondly remembered by Americans as one of the creators of the United States.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11. What did the speaker say about Benjamin Franklin?
12. How did Franklin help George Washington?
13. According to the passage, what is Franklin still well remembered as?
Passage Two
Yuppies are young people who earn a lot of money and live in a style that is too expensive for most people. If you’re invited to a yuppie dinner party, don’t be surprised if you’re offered freshly-cooked insects as a first course. While the idea of eating fried insects fills most of us with horror, insect-eating is becoming highly fashionable. For example, in the media industry, successful executives are often seen to eat fried or boiled insects from time to time while working at their desks. These safe-to-eat insects can be found and ordered on the Internet. And young people are logging on to exotic food websites and ordering samples of prepared insects to serve at their dinner parties. Although the idea of eating insects is probably disgusting to most of us, few people would claim that pigs, chickens, and some kind of seafood we often eat are examples of great beauty. One day, insects could be marketed and sold as food item in supermarket. According to their fans, they are not only high in protein and low in fat, but also very tasty. But until our attitudes to food change fundamentally, it seems that insect-eaters will remain a select few.
Questions 14 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14. Why did the speaker say we might be surprised at the yuppie dinner party?
15. Where can the people order the unusual food mentioned by the speaker?
16. Why are some yuppies attracted by the unusual food?
17. What does the speaker say about the future of this type of unusual food?
Passage Three
Many people dislike walking to the bank, standing in long lines and running out of checks. They are dissatisfied with that bank’s limited hours, too. They want to do some banking at nights and on weekends. For such people, their problems may soon be over. Before long, they may be able to do their banking from the comfort of their own home, any hour of the day, any day of the week. Many banks are preparing online branches or Internet offices, which means that people will be able to take care of much of their banking business through their home computers. This process is called “interactive banking”. At these online branches, customers will be able to view all their accounts, move money between their accounts, apply for a loan and get current information on product such as credit cards. Customers will also be able to pay their bills electrically and even email questions to their bank. Banks are creating online services for several reasons. One reason is that banks must compete for customers who will switch to another bank if they are dissatisfied with the service they receive. The convenience of online banking appeals to the kind of customer banks most want to keep. That is, people who are young, well-educated and have good incomes. Banks also want to take advantage of modern technology since they have moved to 21st century.
Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18. What is one of the reasons for people’s dissatisfaction with traditional banks?
19. What kind of customers does online banking most appeal to?
20. Why do banks create online services according to the passage?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Throughout the nation’s more than 15,000 school districts, widely differing approaches to teaching science and math have emerged. Though there can be strength in diversity, a new international analysis suggests that this variability has instead contributed to lackluster (平淡的) achievement scores by U.S. children relative to their peers in other developed countries.
Indeed, concludes William H. Schmidt of Michigan State University, who led the new analysis, “no single intellectually coherent vision dominates U.S. educational practice in math or science.” The reason, he said, “is because the system is deeply and fundamentally flawed.”
The new analysis, released this week by the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va., is based on data collected from about 50 nations as part of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.
Not only do approaches to teaching science and math vary among individual U.S. communities, the report finds, but there appears to be little strategic focus within a school district’s curricula, its textbooks, or its teachers’ activities. This contrasts sharply with the coordinated national programs of most other countries.
On average, U.S. students study more topics within science and math than their international counterparts do. This creates an educational environment that “is a mile wide and an inch deep,” Schmidt notes.
For instance, eighth graders in the United States cover about 33 topics in math versus just 19 in Japan. Among science courses, the international gap is even wider. U.S. curricula for this age level resemble those of a small group of countries including Australia, Thailand, Iceland, and Bulgaria. Schmidt asks whether the United States wants to be classed with these nations, whose educational systems “share our pattern of splintered (支离破碎的) visions” but which are not economic leaders.
The new report “couldn’t come at a better time,” says Gerald Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association in Arlington. “The new National Science Education Standards provide that focused vision,” including the call “to do less, but in greater depth.”
Implementing the new science standards and their math counterparts will be the challenge, he and Schmidt agree, because the decentralized responsibility for education in the United States requires that any reforms be tailored and instituted one community at a time.
In fact, Schmidt argues, reforms such as these proposed national standards “face an almost impossible task, because even though they are intellectually coherent, each becomes only one more voice in the babble (嘈杂声).”
21. According to the passage, the teaching of science and math in America is ________.
A) losing its vitality gradually
B) characterized by its diversity
C) going downhill in recent years
D) focused on tapping students’ potential
22. The fundamental flaw of American school education is that ________.
A) it attaches too much importance to intensive study of school subjects
B) it relies heavily on the initiative of individual teachers
C) it sets a very low academic standard for students
D) it lacks a coordinated national program
23. By saying that the U.S. educational environment is “a mile wide and an inch deep” (Line 2, Para. 5), the author means U.S. educational practice ________.
A) scratches the surface of a wide range of topics
B) lays stress on quality at the expense of quantity
C) encourages learning both in depth and in scope
D) offers an environment for comprehensive education
24. The new National Science Education Standards are good news in that they will ________.
A) solve most of the problems in school teaching
B) provide depth to school science education
C) quickly dominate U.S. educational practice
D) be able to meet the demands of the community

B) there is always controversy in educational circles
C) not enough educators have realized the necessity for doing so
D) school districts are responsible for making their own decisions
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
I had an experience some years ago which taught me something about the ways in which people make a bad situation worse by blaming themselves. One January, I had to officiate at two funerals on successive days for two elderly women in my community. Both had died “full of years,” as the Bible would say; both yielded to the normal wearing out of the body after a long and full life. Their homes happened to be near each other, so I paid condolence (吊唁) calls on the two families on the same afternoon.
At the first home, the son of the deceased (已故的) woman said to me, “If only I had sent my mother to Florida and gotten her out of this cold and snow, she would be alive today. It’s my fault that she died.” At the second home, the son of the other deceased woman said, “If only I hadn’t insisted on my mother’s going to Florida, she would be alive today. That long airplane ride, the abrupt change of climate, was more than she could take. It’s my fault that she’s dead.”
When things don’t turn out as we would like them to, it is very tempting to assume that had we done things differently, the story would have had a happier ending. Priests know that any time there is a death, the survivors will feel guilty. Because the course of action they took turned out badly, they believe that the opposite course-keeping Mother at home, postponing the operation―would have turned out better. After all, how could it have turned out any worse?
There seem to be two elements involved in our readiness to feel guilt. The first is our pressing need to believe that the world makes sense, that there is a cause for every effect and a reason for everything that happens. That leads us to find patterns and connections both where they really exist and where they exist only in our minds.
The second element is the notion that we are the cause of what happens, especially the bad things that happen. It seems to be a short step from believing that every event has a cause to believing that every disaster is our fault. The roots of this feeling may lie in our childhood. Psychologists speak of the infantile myth of omnipotence (万能). A baby comes to think that the world exists to meet his needs, and that he makes everything happen in it. He wakes up in the morning and summons the rest of the world to its tasks. He cries, and someone comes to attend to him. When he is hungry, people feed him, and when he is wet, people change him. Very often, we do not completely outgrow that infantile notion that our wishes cause things to happen.
26. What is said about the two deceased elderly women?
A) They lived out a natural life.
B) They died due to lack of care by family members.
C) They died of exhaustion after the long plane ride.
D) They weren’t accustomed to the change in weather.
27. The author had to conduct the two women’s funerals probably because ________.
A) he had great sympathy for the deceased
B) he wanted to console the two families
C) he was priest of the local church
D) he was an official from the community
28. People feel guilty for the deaths of their loved ones because ________.
A) they believe that they were responsible
B) they had neglected the natural course of events
C) they couldn’t find a better way to express their grief
D) they didn’t know things often turn out in the opposite direction
29. In the context of the passage, “... the world makes sense” (Line 2, Para, 4) probably means that ________.
A) we have to be sensible in order to understand the world
B) everything in the world is predetermined
C) there’s an explanation for everything in the world
D) the world can be interpreted in different ways
30. People have been made to believe since infancy that ________.
A) every story should have a happy ending
B) their wishes are the cause of everything that happens
C) life and death is an unsolved mystery
D) everybody is at their command
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
“I’ve never met a human worth cloning,” says cloning expert Mark Westhusin from his lab at Texas A&M University. “It’s a stupid endeavor.” That’s an interesting choice of adjective, coming from a man who has spent millions of dollars trying to clone a 13-year-old dog named Missy. So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and expect to clone a cat soon. They just might succeed in cloning Missy this spring―or perhaps not for another 5 years. It seems the reproductive system of man’s best friend is one of the mysteries of modern science.
Westhusin’s experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog’s eggs, the A&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos (胚胎) carrying Missy’s DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate (代孕的) mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted fetuses (胎) may be acceptable when you’re dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. “Cloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,” he says.
Even so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1997, Westhusin’s phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. “A lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,” says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy’s mysterious billionaire owner; he’s put up $3.7 million so far to fund A&M’s research.
Contrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy’s fine qualities after she does die. The prototype is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and supersmart. Missy’s master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament. In a statement of purpose, Missy’s owner and the A&M team say they are “both looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy.”
Besides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs, nurture. It could also lead to the cloning of special rescue dogs and many endangered animals.
However, Westhusin is cautious about his work. He knows that even if he gets a dog pregnant, the offspring, should they survive, will face the problems shown at birth by other cloned animals: abnormalities like immature lungs and heart and weight problems~ “Why would you ever want to clone humans,Westhusin asks, “when we’re not even close to getting it worked out in animals yet?”
31. By “stupid endeavor” (Line 2, Para. 1), Westhusin means to say that ________.
A) human cloning is a foolish undertaking
B) animal cloning is absolutely impractical
C) human cloning should be done selectively
D) animal cloning is not worth the effort at all
32. What does the first paragraph tell us about Westhusin’s dog cloning project?
A) Its success is already in sight.
B) It is doomed to utter failure.
C) It is progressing smoothly.
D) Its outcome remains uncertain.
33. By cloning Missy, Mark Westhusin hopes to ________.
A) examine the reproductive system of the dog species
B) find out the differences between Missy and its clones
C) search for ways to modify.its temperament
D) study the possibility of cloning humans
34. We learn from the passage that animal clones are likely to have ________.
A) an abnormal shape
B) a bad temper
C) defective organs
D) immune deficiency
35. It can be seen that present cloning techniques ________.
A) provide insight into the question of nature vs, nurture
B) have been widely used in saving endangered species
C) have proved quite adequate for the cloning of humans
D) still have a long way to go before reaching maturity
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Frustrated with delays in Sacramento, Bay Area officials said Thursday they planned to take matters into their own hands to regulate the region’s growing pile of electronic trash.
A San Jose councilwoman and a San Francisco supervisor said they would propose local initiatives aimed at controlling electronic waste if the California law-making body fails to act on two bills stalled in the Assembly. They are among a growing number of California cities and counties that have expressed the same intention.
Environmentalists and local governments are increasingly concerned about the toxic hazard posed by old electronic devices and the cost of safely recycling those products. An estimated 6 million televisions and computers are stocked in California homes, and an additional 6,000 to 7,000 computers become outdated every day. The machines contain high levels of lead and other hazardous substances, and are already banned from California landfills (垃圾填埋场).
Legislation by Senator Byron Sher would require consumers to pay a recycling fee of up to $30 on every new machine containing a cathode (阴极) ray tube. Used in almost all video monitors and televisions, those devices contain four to eight pounds of lead each. The fees would go toward setting up recycling programs, providing grants to non-profit agencies that reuse the tubes and rewarding manufacturers that encourage recycling.
A separate bill by Los Angeles-area Senator Gloria Romero would require high-tech manufacturers to develop programs to recycle so-called e-waste.
If passed, the measures would put California at the forefront of national efforts to manage the refuse of the electronic age.
But high-tech groups, including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and the American Electronics Association, oppose the measures, arguing that fees of up to $30 will drive consumers to online, out-of-state retailers.
“What really needs to occur is consumer education. Most consumers are unaware they’re not supposed to throw computers in the trash,” said Roxanne Gould, vice president of government relations for the electronics association.
Computer recycling should be a local effort and part of residential waste collection programs, she added.
Recycling electronic waste is a dangerous and specialized matter, and environmentalists maintain the state must support recycling efforts and ensure that the job isn’t contracted to unscrupulous (毫无顾忌的) junk dealers who send the toxic parts overseas.
“The graveyard of the high-tech revolution is ending up in rural China,” said Ted Smith, director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. His group is pushing for an amendment to Sher’s bill that would prevent the export of e-waste.
36. What step were Bay Area officials going to take regarding e-waste disposal?
A) Rally support to pass the stalled bills.
B) Lobby the lawmakers of the California Assembly.
C) Lay down relevant local regulations themselves.
D) Exert pressure on manufacturers of electronic devices.
37. The two bills stalled in the California Assembly both concern ________.
A) the reprocessing of the huge amounts of electronic waste in the state
B) regulations on dumping hazardous substances into landfills
C) the funding of local initiatives to reuse electronic trash
D) the sale of used electronic devices to foreign countries
38. Consumers are not supposed to throw used computers in the trash because ________.
A) this is banned by the California government
B) some parts may be recycled for use elsewhere
C) unscrupulous dealers will retrieve them for profit
D) they contain large amounts of harmful substances
39. High-tech groups believe that if an extra $30 is charged on every TV or computer purchased in California, consumers will ________.
A) hesitate to upgrade their computers
B) abandon online shopping
C) buy them from other states
D) strongly protest against such a charge
40. We learn from the passage that much of California’s electronic waste has been ________.
A) dumped into local landfills
B) exported to foreign countries
C) collected by non-profit agencies
D) recycled by computer manufacturers

The World Health Organization (WHO) says its ten-year campaign to remove leprosy (麻风病) as a world health problem has been successful. Doctor Brundtland, head of the WHO, says a number of leprosy cases around the world has (S1) been cut of ninety percent during the past ten years. She says (S2) efforts are continuing to complete end the disease. (S3)
Leprosy is caused by bacteria spread through liquid from the nose and mouth. The disease mainly effects the skin and (S4) nerves. However, if leprosy is not treated it can cause permanent damage for the skin, nerves, eyes, arms or legs. (S5)
In 1999, an international campaign began to end leprosy. The WHO, governments of countries most affected by the disease, and several other groups are part of the campaign. This alliance guarantees that all leprosy patients, even they (S6) are poor, have a right to the most modern treatment.
Doctor Brundtland says leprosy is no longer a disease that requires life-long treatments by medical experts. Instead, patients can take that is called a multi-drug therapy. This (S7) modern treatment will cure leprosy in 6 to 12 months, depend on the form of the disease. The treatment combines (S8) several drugs taken daily or once a month. The WHO has given multi-drug therapy to patients freely for the last five (S9) years. The members of the alliance against leprosy plan to target the countries which still threatened by leprosy. Among (S10) the estimated 600,000 victims around the world, the WHO believes about 70% are in India. The disease also remains a problem in Africa and South America.

Passage One
Both John and Sue joined the staff of a successful public relations firm in New York during the same year. They had just completed their PR degrees at a nearby university and were thrilled to be hired by one of the finest PR firms in the city. John’s first assignment was to create a promotion campaign for a client who was putting a new game on the market. Initially Sue was assigned to work with a sportswear company on a marketing concept for its newest line of clothing. As time passed and work with their respective first clients became more and more difficult, John and Sue realized that they had been assigned two of the toughest clients in town. Although John completed his assignments quickly and successfully, he was furious when he learned that the boss had deliberately assigned him a difficult client. In response he not only complained to his colleagues but also to the boss’s secretary. Sue, on the other hand, had a more difficult time satisfying her first client and she took several additional months to actually complete the assignment. However, she just laughed when she heard that the boss had made the assignment purposely. Over the next two years, John worked reluctantly with each assignment and problem that he encountered. Sue accepted each assignment cheerfully. And when problems arose, she responded with her characteristic “No problem, I can handle it.” Although Sue took longer to complete her projects than John and both were equally successful on the assignments they completed, Sue was given the first promotion when there came a vacancy.
Questions 11 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11. What’s the relationship between John and Sue now?
12. Why was John furious after he finished his first assignment?
13. What’s Sue’s attitude to difficult tasks?
14. How does the story end?
Passage Two
American visitors to Eastern Asia are often surprised and puzzled by how Asian cultures and customs differ from those in the United States. What’s considered typical or proper social conduct in one country may be regard as odd, improper or even rude in the other. For example, people from some Eastern Asian countries may begin a conversation with a stranger by asking personal questions about family, home or work. Such questions are thought to be friendly, whereas they might be considered offensive in the United States. On the other hand, people in most Asian cultures are far more guarded about expressing their feelings publicly than most Americans are. Openly displaying annoyance or anger, yelling, arguing loudly and so forth is considered ill-mannered in countries such as Japan. Many Eastern Asians prefer to hold their emotions in check and instead express themselves with great politeness. They try not to be blunt and avoid making direct criticisms. In fact, they often keep their differences of opinion to themselves and merely smile and remain silent rather than engage in a confrontation. By comparison, Americans are often frank about displaying both positive and negative emotions on the street and in other public places. Americans visiting Asia should keep in mind that such behavior may cause offense. A major difference between Americans culture and most Eastern Asian cultures is that in Eastern Asia, the community is more important than the individual. Most Americans are considered a success when they make a name for themselves.
Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
15. How would some Asians start their conversation when they meet for the first time?
16. What would a Japanese do when he feels annoyed?
17. What is encouraged in American culture according to the passage?
Passage Three
In order for a chemical to be considered a drug, it must have the capacity to affect how the body works. No substance that has the power to do this is completely safe. Drugs are approved only after tests have demonstrated that they are relatively safe when used as directed and when their benefits outweigh their risks. Thus some very dangerous drugs are approved because they are necessary to treat serious illnesses. Many people suffer ill effects from drugs called side effects, even though they take the drug exactly as directed. The human population contains a great variety of genetic variation, but drugs are tested on just a few thousand people. When a particular drug is taken by millions, some people may not respond in a predictable way, even though the drug has been tested. A patient may also acquire a tolerance for a certain drug, which means the patient has to take ever larger doses to produce the desired effect. Tolerance may lead to habituation, in which the person becomes so dependent on the drug that he or she becomes addicted to it. Addition causes severe psychological and physical disturbances when the drug is taken away. Finally, drugs often have unwanted side effects. This usually causes only minor discomfort, such as a skin rash, headache or sleepiness. Certain drugs, however, can produce serious adverse reactions.
Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18. Under what circumstances are drugs approved?
19. Why do many people suffer side effects from a drug even though they take it as directed?
20. What will happen when patients acquire a tolerance for a certain drug?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.
Passage One
Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.
Low-level slash-and-burn farming doesn’t harm rainforest. On the contrary, it helps farmers and improves forest soils. This is the unorthodox view of a German soil scientist who has shown that burnt clearings in the Amazon, dating back more than 1,000 years, helped create patches of rich, fertile soil that farmers still benefit from today.
Most rainforest soils are thin and poor because they lack minerals and because the heat and heavy rainfall destroy most organic matter in the soils within four years of it reaching the forest floor. This means topsoil contains few of the ingredients needed for long-term successful farming.
But Bruno Glaser, a soil scientist of the University of Bayreuth, has studied unexpected patches of fertile soils in the central Amazon. These soils contain lots of organic matter.
Glaser has shown that most of this fertile organic matter comes from “black carbon”―the organic particles from camp fires and charred (烧成炭的) wood left over from thousands of years of slash-and-burn farming. “The soils, known as Terra Preta, contained up to 70times more black carbon than the surrounding soil, “says Glaser.
Unburnt vegetation rots quickly, but black carbon persists in the soil for many centuries. Radiocarbon dating shows that the charred wood in Terra Preta soils is typically more than 1,000 years old.
“Slash-and-burn farming can be good for soils provided it doesn’t completely burn all the vegetation, and leaves behind charred wood,” says Glaser. “It can be better than manure (粪肥).” Burning the forest just once can leave behind enough black carbon to keep the soil fertile for thousands of years. And rainforests easily regrow after small-scale clearing. Contrary to the conventional view that human activities damage the environment, Glaser says: “Black carbon combined with human wastes is responsible for the richness of Terra Preta soils.”
Terra Preta soils turn up in large patches all over the Amazon, where they are highly prized by farmers. All the patches fall within 500 square kilometers in the central Amazon. Glaser says the widespread presence of pottery (陶器) confirms the soil’s human origins.
The findings add weight to the theory that large areas of the Amazon have recovered so well from past periods of agricultural use that the regrowth has been mistaken by generations of biologists for “virgin” forest.
During the past decade, researchers have discovered hundreds of large earth works deep in the jungle. They are up to 20 meters high and cover up to a square kilometer. Glaser claims that these earth works, built between AD 400 and 1400, were at the heart of urban civilizations. Now it seems the richness of the Terra Preta soils may explain how such civilizations managed to feed themselves.

12. Most rainforest soils are thin and poor because ________.
A) the composition of the topsoil is rather unstable
B) black carbon is washed away by heavy rains
C) organic matter is quickly lost due to heat and rain
D) long-term farming has exhausted the ingredients essential to plant growth
13. Glaser made his discovery by ________.
A) studying patches of fertile soils in the central Amazon
B) examining pottery left over by ancient civilizations
C) test-burning patches of trees in the central Amazon
D) radiocarbon-dating ingredients contained in forest soils
14. What does Glaser say about the regrowth of rainforests?
A) They take centuries to regrow after being burnt.
B) They cannot recover unless the vegetation is burnt completely.
C) Their regrowth will be hampered by human habitation.

Passage Two
Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.
As a wise man once said, we are all ultimately alone. But an increasing number of Europeans are choosing to be so at an ever earlier age. This isn’t the stuff of gloomy philosophical contemplations, but a fact of Europe’s new economic landscape, embraced by sociologists, real-estate developers and ad executives alike. The shift away from family life to solo lifestyle, observes a French sociologist, is part of the “irresistible momentum of individualism” over the last century. The communications revolution, the shift from a business culture of stability to one of mobility and the mass entry of women into the workforce have greatly wreaked havoc on (扰乱) Europeans’ private lives.
Europe’s new economic climate has largely fostered the trend toward independence. The current generation of home-aloners came of age during Europe’s shift from social democracy to the sharper, more individualistic climate of American style capitalism. Raised in an era of privatization and increased consumer choice, today’s tech-savvy (精通技术的) workers have embraced a free market in love as well as economics. Modern Europeans are rich enough to afford to live alone, and temperamentally independent enough to want to do so.
Once upon a time, people who lived alone tended to be those on either side of marriage-twenty something professionals or widowed senior citizens. While pensioners, particularly elderly women, make up a large proportion of those living alone, the newest crop of singles are high earners in their 30s and 40s who increasingly view living alone as a lifestyle choice. Living alone was conceived to be negative-dark and cold, while being together suggested warmth and light. But then came along the idea of singles. They were young, beautiful, strong! Now, young people want to live alone.
The booming economy means people are working harder than ever. And that doesn’t leave much room for relationships. Pimpi Arroyo, a 35-year-old composer who lives alone in a house in Paris, says he hasn’t got time to get lonely because he has too much work. “I have deadlines which would make life with someone else fairly difficult.” Only an Ideal Woman would make him change his lifestyle, he says. Kaufmann, author of a recent book called “The Single Woman and Prince Charming,” thinks this fierce new individualism means that people expect more and more of mates, so relationships don’t last long-if they start at all. Eppendorf, a blond Berliner with a deep tan, teaches grade school in the mornings. In the afternoon she sunbathes or sleeps, resting up for going dancing. Just shy of 50, she says she’d never have wanted to do what her mother did-give up a career to raise a family. Instead, “I’ve always done what I wanted to do: live a self-determined life.”
16. More and more young Europeans remain single because ________.
A) they are driven by an overwhelming sense of individualism
B) they have entered the workforce at a much earlier age
C) they have embraced a business culture of stability
D) they are pessimistic about their economic future
17. What is said about European society in the passage?
A) It has fostered the trend towards small families.
B) It is getting closer to American-style capitalism.
C) It has limited consumer choice despite a free market.
D) It is being threatened by irresistible privatization.
18. According to Paragraph 3, the newest group of singles are ________.
A) warm and lighthearted
B) on either side of marriage
C) negative and gloomy
D) healthy and wealthy
19. The author quotes Eppendorf to show that ________.
A) some modern women prefer a life of individual freedom
B) the family is no longer the basic unit of society in present-day Europe
C) some professional people have too much work to do to feel lonely
D) most Europeans conceive living a single life as unacceptable
20. What is the author’s purpose in writing the passage?
A) To review the impact of women becoming high earners.
B) To contemplate the philosophy underlying individualism.
C) To examine the trend of young people living alone.
D) To stress the rebuilding of personal relationships.
Passage Three
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Supporters of the biotech industry have accused an American scientist of misconduct after she testified to the New Zealand government that a genetically modified (GM) bacterium could cause serious damage if released.
The New Zealand Life Sciences Network, an association of pro-GM scientists and organisations, says the view expressed by Elaine Ingham, a soil biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, was exaggerated and irresponsible. It has asked her university to discipline her.
But Ingham stands by her comments and says the complaints are an attempt to silence her. “They’re trying to cause trouble with my university and get me fired,” Ingham told New Scientist.
The controversy began on 1 February, when Ingham testified before New Zealand’s Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, which will determine how to regulate GM organisms. Ingham claimed that a GM version of a common soil bacterium could spread and destroy plants if released into the wild. Other researchers had previously modified the bacterium to produce alcohol from organic waste. But Ingham says that when she put it in soil with wheat plants, all of the plants died within a week.
“We would lose terrestrial (陆生的) plants... this is an organism that is potentially deadly to the continued survival of human beings,” she told the commission. She added that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) canceled its approval for field tests using the organism once she had told them about her research in 1999.
But last week the New Zealand Life Sciences Network accused Ingham of “presenting inaccurate, careless and exaggerated information” and “generating speculative doomsday scenarios (世界末日的局面) that are not scientifically supportable”. They say that her study doesn’t even show that the bacteria would survive in the wild, much less kill massive numbers of plants. What’s more, the network says that contrary to Ingham’s claims, the EPA was never asked to consider the organism for field trials.
The EPA has not commented on the dispute. But an e-mail to the network from Janet Anderson, director of the EPA’s bio-pesticides (生物杀虫剂) division, says “there is no record of a review and/or clearance to field test” the organism.
Ingham says EPA officials had told her that the organism was approved for field tests, but says she has few details. It’s also not clear whether the organism, first engineered by a German institute for biotechnology, is still in use.
Whether Ingham is right or wrong, her supporters say opponents are trying unfairly to silence her.
“I think her concerns should be taken seriously. She shouldn’t be harassed in this way,” says Ann Clarke, a plant biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada who also testified before the commission. “It’s an attempt to silence the opposition.”
21. The passage centers on the controversy ________.
A) between American and New Zealand biologists over genetic modification
B) as to whether the study of genetic modification should be continued
C) over the possible adverse effect of a GM bacterium on plants
D) about whether Elaine Ingham should be fired by her university
22. Ingham insists that her testimony is based on ________.
A) evidence provided by the EPA of the United States
B) the results of an experiment she conducted herself
C) evidence from her collaborative research with German biologists
D) the results of extensive field tests in Corvallis, Oregon
23. According to Janet Anderson, the EPA ________.
A) has cancelled its approval for field tests of the GM organism
B) hasn’t reviewed the findings of Ingham’s research
C) has approved field tests using the GM organism
D) hasn’t given permission to field test the GM organism
24. According to Ann Clarke, the New Zealand Life Sciences Network ________.
A) should gather evidence to discredit Ingham’s claims
B) should require that the research by their biologists be regulated
C) shouldn’t demand that Ingham be disciplined for voicing her views
D) shouldn’t appease the opposition in such a quiet way
25. Which of the following statements about Ingham is TRUE?
A) Her testimony hasn’t been supported by the EPA.
B) Her credibility as a scientist hasn’t been undermined.
C) She is firmly supported by her university.
D) She has made great contributions to the study of GM bacteria.
Passage Four
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Every fall, like clockwork, Linda Krentz of Beaverton, Oregon, felt her brain go on strike. “I just couldn’t get going in the morning,” she says. “I’d get depressed and gain 10 pounds every winter and lose them again in the spring.” Then she read about seasonal affective disorder, a form of depression that occurs in fall and winter, and she saw the light-literally. Every morning now she turns on a specially constructed light box for half an hour and sits in front of it to trick her brain into thinking it’s still enjoying those long summer days. It seems to work.
Krentz is not alone. Scientists estimate that 10 million Americans suffer from seasonal depression and 25 million more develop milder versions. But there’s never been definitive proof that treatment with very bright lights makes a difference. After all, it’s hard to do a double-blind test when the subjects can see for themselves whether or not the light is on. That’s why nobody has ever separated the real effects of light therapy from placebo (安慰剂) effects.
Until now. In three separate studies published last month, researchers report not only that light therapy works better than a placebo but that treatment is usually more effective in the early morning than in the evening. In two of the groups, the placebo problem was resolved by telling patients they were comparing light boxes to a new anti-depressant device that emits negatively charged ions (离子). The third used the timing of light therapy as the control.
Why does light therapy work? No one really knows. “Our research suggests it has something to do with shifting the body’s internal clock,” says psychiatrist Dr. Lewey. The body is programmed to start the day with sunrise, he explains, and this gets later as the days get shorter. But why such subtle shifts make some people depressed and not others is a mystery.
That hasn’t stopped thousands of winter depressives from trying to heal themselves. Light boxes for that purpose are available without a doctor’s prescription. That bothers psychologist Michael Terman of Columbia University. He is worried that the boxes may be tried by patients who suffer from mental illness that can’t be treated with light. Terman has developed a questionnaire to help determine whether expert care is needed.
In any event, you should choose a reputable manufacturer. Whatever product you use should emit only visible light, because ultraviolet light damages the eyes. If you are photosensitive (对光敏感的), you may develop a rash. Otherwise, the main drawback is having to sit in front of the light for 30 to 60 minutes in the morning. That’s an inconvenience many winter depressives can live with.
26. What is the probable cause of Krentz’s problem?
A) An unexpected gain in body weight.
B) Unexplained impairment of her nervous system.
C) Weakening of her eyesight with the setting in of winter.
D) Poor adjustment of her body clock to seasonal changes.
27. By saying that Linda Krentz saw the light” (Line 4, Para. 1), the author means that she ________.
A) learned how to lose weight
B) realized what her problem was
C) came to see the importance of light
D) became light-hearted and cheerful
28. What is the CURRENT view concerning the treatment of seasonal depression with bright lights?
A) Its effect remains to be seen.
B) It serves as a kind of placebo.
C) It proves to be an effective therapy.
D) It hardly produces any effects.
29. What is psychologist Michael Terman’s major concern?
A) Winter depressives will be addicted to using light boxes.
B) No mental patients would bother to consult psychiatrists.
C) Inferior light boxes will emit harmful ultraviolet lights.
D) Light therapy could be misused by certain mental patients.
30. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
A) Winter depressives prefer light therapy in spite of its inconvenience.
B) Light therapy increases the patient’s photosensitivity.
C) Eye damage is a side effect of light therapy.
D) Light boxes can be programmed to correspond to shifts in the body clock.

Compound Dictation
Certain phrases one commonly hears among Americans capture their devotion to individualism. “Do you own thing.” “I did it my way.” “You’ll have to decide that for yourself.” “You made your bed, now lie in it.” “If you don’t look out for yourself, no one else will.” “Look out for number one.”
Closely associated with the value they place on individualism, is the importance American’s assign to privacy. Americans assume that people need some time to themselves or some time alone to think about things or to recover their spent psychological energy. Americans have great difficulty understanding foreigners who always want to be with another person who dislikes being alone.
If the parents can afford it, each child will have his or her own bedroom. Having one’s own bedroom even as an infant, fixes in a person the notion that she is entitled to a place of her own where she can be by herself, and keep her possessions. She will have her clothes, her toys, her books, and so on. These things will be hers, no one else’s.
Americans assume that people will have their private thoughts that might never be shared with anyone. Doctors, lawyers, psychologists and others have rules governing confidentiality that are intended to prevent information about their clients’ personal situations from being know to others.
American’s attitudes about privacy can be hard for foreigners to understand American’s houses, yards, and even their offices can seem open and inviting. Yet, in the minds of Americans, there are boundaries that other people are simply not supposed to cross. When those boundaries are crossed, an American’s body will visibly stiffen and his manner will be cool and aloof.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage one
Too many vulnerable child-free adults are being ruthlessly (无情的) manipulated into parent-hood by their parents, who think that happiness among older people depends on having a grand-child to spoil. We need an organization to help beat down the persistent campaigns of grandchildless parents. It’s time to establish Planned Grandparenthood, which would have many global and local benefits.
Part of its mission would be to promote the risks and realities associated with being a grandparent. The staff would include depressed grandparents who would explain how grandkids break lamps, bite, scream and kick. Others would detail how an hour of baby-sitting often turns into a crying marathon. More grandparents would testify that they had to pay for their grandchild’s expensive college education.
Planned grandparenthood’s carefully written literature would detail all the joys of life grand-child-free a calm living room, extra money for luxuries during the golden years, etc. Potential grandparents would be reminded that, without grandchildren around, it’s possible to have a conversation with your kids, who―incidentally―would have more time for their own parents.
Meanwhile, most children are vulnerable to the enormous influence exerted by grandchildless parents aiming to persuade their kids to produce children. They will take a call from a persistent parent, even if they’re loaded with works. In addition, some parents make handsome money offers payable upon the grandchild’s birth. Sometimes these gifts not only cover expenses associated with the infant’s birth, but extras, too, like a vacation. In any case, cash gifts can weaken the resolve of even the noblest person.
At Planned Grandparenthood, children targeted by their parents to reproduce could obtain non-biased information about the insanity of having their own kids. The catastrophic psychological and economic costs of childbearing would be emphasized. The symptoms of morning sickness would be listed and horrors of childbirth pictured. A monthly newsletter would contain stories about overwhelmed parents and offer guidance on how childless adults can respond to the different lobbying tactics that would-be grandparents employ.
When I think about all the problems of our overpopulated world and look at our boy grabbing at the lamp by the sofa, I wish I could have turned to Planned Grandparenthood when my parents were putting the grandchild squeeze on me.
If I could have, I might not be in this parenthood predicament (窘境). But here’s the crazy irony, I don’t want my child-free life back. Dylan’s too much fun.
21. What’s the purpose of the proposed organization Planned Grandparenthood?
A) To encourage childless couples to have children.
B) To provide facilities and services for grandchildless parents.
C) To offer counseling to people on how to raise grandchildren.
D) To discourage people from insisting on having grandchildren.
22. Planned Grandparenthood would include depressed grandparents on its staff in order to ________.
A) show them the joys of life grandparents may have in raising grandchildren
B) draw attention to the troubles and difficulties grandchildren may cause
C) share their experience in raising grandchildren in a more scientific way
D) help raise funds to cover the high expense of education for grandchildren
23. According to the passage, some couples may eventually choose to have children because ________.
A) they find it hard to resist the carrot-and-stick approach of their parents
B) they have learn from other parents about the joys of having children
C) they feel more and more lonely ad they grow older
D) they have found it irrational to remain childless
24. By saying “... my parents were putting the grandchild squeeze on me” (Line 2-3, Para. 6), the author means that ________.
A) her parents kept pressuring her to have a child
B) her parents liked to have a grandchild in their arms

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Ask most people how they define the American Dream and chances are they’ll say, “Success.” The dream of individual opportunity has been home in American since Europeans discovered a “new world” in the Western Hemisphere. Early immigrants like Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur praised highly the freedom and opportunity to be found in this new land. His glowing descriptions of a classless society where anyone could attain success through honesty and hard work fired the imaginations of many European readers: in Letters from an American Farmer (1782) he wrote. “We are all excited at the spirit of an industry which is unfettered (无拘无束的) and unrestrained, because each person works for himself ... We have no princes, for whom we toil (干苦力活)，starve, and bleed: we are the most perfect society now existing in the world.” The promise of a land where “the rewards of a man’s industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labor” drew poor immigrants from Europe and fueled national expansion into the western territories.
Our national mythology (神化) is full of illustration the American success story. There’s Benjamin Franklin, the very model of the self-educated, self-made man, who rose from modest origins to become a well-known scientist, philosopher, and statesman. In the nineteenth century, Horatio Alger, a writer of fiction for young boys, became American’s best-selling author with rags-to-riches tales. The notion of success haunts us: we spend million every year reading about the rich and famous, learning how to “make a fortune in real estate with no money down,” and “dressing for success.” The myth of success has even invaded our personal relationships: today it’s as important to be “successful” in marriage or parenthoods as it is to come out on top in business.
But dreams easily turn into nightmares. Every American who hopes to “make it” also knows the fear of failure, because the myth of success inevitably implies comparison between the haves and the have-nots, the stars and the anonymous crowd. Under pressure of the myth, we become indulged in status symbols: we try to live in the “right” neighborhoods, wear the “right” clothes, eat the “right” foods. These symbols of distinction assure us and others that we believe strongly in the fundamental equality of all, yet strive as hard as we can to separate ourselves from our fellow citizens.
26. What is the essence of the American Dream according to Crevecoeur?
A) People are free to develop their power of imagination.
B) People who are honest and work hard can succeed.
C) People are free from exploitation and oppression.
D) People can fully enjoy individual freedom.
27. By saying “the rewards of a man’s industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labor” (Line 10, Para. 1), the author means ________.
A) the more diligent one is, the bigger his returns
B) laborious work ensures the growth of an industry
C) a man’s business should be developed step by step
D) a company’s success depends on its employees’ hard work
28. The characters described in Horatio Alger’s novels are people who ________.
A) succeed in real estate investment
B) earned enormous fortunes by chances
C) became wealthy after starting life very poor
D) became famous despite their modest origins
29. It can be inferred from the last sentence of the second paragraph that ________.
A) business success often contributes to a successful marriage
B) Americans wish to succeed in every aspect of life
C) good personal relationships lead to business success
D) successful business people provide good care for their children
30. What is the paradox of American culture according to the author?
A) The American road to success is full of nightmares.
B) Status symbols are not a real indicator of a person’s wealth.
C) The American Dream is nothing but an empty dream.
D) What Americans strive after often contradicts their beliefs.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Public distrust of scientists stems in part from the blurring of boundaries between science and technology, between discovery and manufacture. Most government, perhaps all governments, justify public expenditure on scientific research in terms of the economic benefits the scientific enterprise ha brought in the past and will bring in the future. Politicians remind their voters of the splendid machines ‘our scientists’ have invented, the new drugs to relieve old ailments (病痛), and the new surgical equipment and techniques by which previously intractable (难治疗的) conditions may now be treated and lives saved. At the same time, the politicians demand of scientists that they tailor their research to ‘economics needs’, that they award a higher priority to research proposals that are ‘near the market’ and can be translated into the greatest return on investment in the shortest time. Dependent, as they are, on politicians for much of their funding, scientists have little choice but to comply. Like the rest of us, they are members of a society that rates the creation of wealth as the greatest possible good. Many have reservations, but keep them to themselves in what they perceive as a climate hostile to the pursuit of understanding for its own sake and the idea of an inquiring, creative spirit.
In such circumstances no one should be too hard on people who are suspicious of conflicts of interest. When we learn that the distinguished professor assuring us of the safety of a particular product holds a consultancy with the company making it, we cannot be blamed for wondering whether his fee might conceivably cloud his professional judgment. Even if the professor holds no consultancy with any firm, some people many still distrust him because of his association with those who do, or at least wonder about the source of some his research funding.
This attitude can have damaging effects. It questions the integrity of individuals working in a profession that prizes intellectual honesty as the supreme virtue, and plays into the hands of those who would like to discredit scientists by representing then a venal (可以收买的). This makes it easier to dismiss all scientific pronouncements, but especially those made by the scientists who present themselves as ‘experts’. The scientist most likely to understand the safety of a nuclear reactor, for example, is a nuclear engineer declares that a reactor is unsafe, we believe him, because clearly it is not to his advantage to lie about it. If he tells us it is safe, on the other hand, we distrust him, because he may well be protecting the employer who pays his salary.
31. What is the chief concern of most governments when it comes to scientific research?
A) Support from the votes.
B) The reduction of public expenditure.
C) Quick economics returns.
D) The budget for a research project.
32. Scientist have to adapt their research to ‘economic needs’ in order to ________.
A) impress the public with their achievements
B) pursue knowledge for knowledge’s sake
C) obtain funding from the government
D) translate knowledge into wealth
33. Why won’t scientists complain about the government’s policy concerning scientific research?
A) They think they work in an environment hostile to the free pursuit of knowledge.
B) They are accustomed to keeping their opinions to themselves.
C) They know it takes patience to win support from the public.
D) They think compliance with government policy is in the interests of the public.
34. According to the author, people are suspicious of the professional judgment of scientists because ________.
A) their pronouncements often turn out to be wrong
B) sometimes they hide the source of their research funding
C) some of them do not give priority to intellectual honesty
D) they could be influenced by their association with the project concerned
35. Why does the author say that public distrust of scientists can have damaging effects?
A) It makes things difficult for scientists seeking research funds.
B) People would not believe scientists even when they tell the truth.
C) It may dampen the enthusiasm of scientists for independent research.
D) Scientists themselves may doubt the value of their research findings.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
In many ways, today’s business environment has changed qualitatively since the late 1980s. The end of the Cold War radically altered the very nature of the world’s politics and economics. In just a few short years, globalization has started a variety of trends with profound consequences: the opening of markets, true global competition, widespread deregulation (解除政府对…的控制) of industry, and an abundance of accessible capital. We have experienced both the benefits and risks of a truly global economy, with both Wall Street and Main Street (平民百姓) feeling the pains of economic disorder half a world away.
At the same time, we have fully entered the Information Age, Starting breakthroughs in information technology have irreversibly altered the ability to conduct business unconstrained by the traditional limitations of time or space. Today, it’s almost impossible to imagine a world without intranets, e-mail, and portable computers. With stunning speed, the Internet is profoundly changing the way we work, shop, do business, and communicate.
As a consequence, we have truly entered the Post-Industrial economy. We are rapidly shifting from an economy based on manufacturing and commodities to one that places the greatest value on information, services, support, and distribution. That shift, in turn, place an unprecedented premium on “knowledge workers,” a new class of wealthy, educated, and mobile people who view themselves as free agents in a seller’s market.
Beyond the realm of information technology, the accelerated pace of technological change in virtually every industry has created entirely new business, wiped out others, and produced a Pervasive (广泛的) demand for continuous innovation. New product, process, and distribution technologies provide powerful levers for creating competitive value. More companies are learning the importance of destructive technologies―innovations that hold the potential to make a product line, or even an entire business segment, virtually outdated.
Another major trend has been the fragmentation of consumer and business markets. There’s a growing appreciation that superficially similar groups of customers may have very different preferences in terms of what they want to buy and how they want to buy it. Now, new technology makes it easier, faster, and cheaper to identify and serve targeted micro-markets in ways that were physically impossible or prohibitively expensive in the past. Moreover, the trend feeds on itself, a business’s ability to serve sub-markets fuels customers’ appetites for more and more specialized offerings.
36. According to the first paragraph, the chances in the business environment in the past decades can be attributed to ________.
A) technological advances
B) worldwide economic disorder
C) the fierce competition in industry
D) the globalization of economy
37. what idea does the author want to convey in the second paragraph?
A) The rapid development of information technology has taken businessmen by surprise.
B) Information technology has removed the restrictions of time and space in business transactions.
C) The Internet, intranets, e-mail, and portable computers have penetrated every corner of the world.
D) The way we do business today has brought about startling breakthroughs in information technology.
38. If a business wants to thrive in the Post-Industrial economy, ________.
A) it has to invest more capital in the training of free agents to operate in a seller’s market
B) it should try its best to satisfy the increasing demands of mobile knowledgeable people
C) it should not overlook the importance of information, services, support, and distribution
D) it has to provide each of its employees with the latest information about the changing market
39. In the author’s view, destructive technologies are innovations which ________.
A) can eliminate an entire business segment
B) demand a radical change in providing services
C) may destroy the potential of a company to make any profit
D) call for continuous improvement in ways of doing business
40. With the fragmentation of consumer and business markets ________.
A) an increasing number of companies have disintegrated
B) manufacturers must focus on one special product to remain competitive in the market
C) it is physically impossible and prohibitively expensive to do business in the old way
D) businesses have to meet individual customers’ specific needs in order to succeed

I had flown from San Francisco to Virginia to attend a conference on multiculturalism. Hundreds of educators from across the country were meeting to discuss the need for greater cultural diversity in the school curriculum. I took a taxi to my hotel. On the way, my driver and I chatted about the whether and the tourists. The driver was a White man in forties. “How long have you been in this country?” he asked. “All my life!” I replied, “I was born in the United States.” With strong southern accent, he remarked, “I was wondering because your English is excellent.” Then I explained as I had done many times before, “My grandfather came here from China in the 1880s. My family has been here in America for ever a hundred years.” He glanced at me in the mirror. Somehow, I didn’t look American to him. My appearance looked foreign. Questions liked the one my taxi driver asked make me feel uncomfortable. But I can understand why he could not see me as an American. He had a narrow but widely shared sense of the past: a history that has viewed Americans as descendants of Europeans. Race has functioned as something necessary to the construction of American character and quality in the creation of our national identity―American has been defined as “white”. But American has been racially diverse since our very beginning on the Virginia shore, where the first group of Englishmen and Africans arrived in the 17th century. And this reality is increasingly become visible everywhere.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11. What was the theme of the conference the speaker was to attend?
12. Why did the taxi driver ask the speaker how long he has been in the US?
13. What message did the speaker wish to convey?
Passage Two
Laws have been written to govern the use of American National Flag, and to ensure proper respect for the flag. Custom has also governed the common practice in regard to its use. All the armed services have precise regulations on how to display the national flag. This may vary somewhat from the general rules. The national flag should be raised and lowered by hand. Do not raise the flag while it is folded. Unfold the flag first, and then hoist it quickly to the top of the flagpole. Lower it slowly and with dignity. Place no objects on or over the flag. Do not use the flag as part of a costume or athletic uniform. Do not print it upon cushions, handkerchiefs, paper napkins or boxes. A federal law provides that the trademark cannot be registered if it comprises the flag, or badgers of the US, When the flag is used to unveil a statue or monument, it shouldn’t serve as a covering of the object to be unveiled. If it is displayed on such occasions, do not allow the flag to fall to the ground, but let it be carried high up in the air to form a feature of the ceremony. Take every precaution to prevent the flag from soiled. It should not be allowed to touch the ground or floor, nor to brush against objects.
Questions 14 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14. How do Americans ensure proper respect for the national flag?
15. What is the regulation regarding the raising of the American National Flag?
16. How should the American National Flag be displayed at an unveiling ceremony?
17. What do we learn about the use of the American National Flag?
Passage Three
In some large American city schools, as many as 20-40% of the students are absent each day. There are two major reasons for such absences: one is sickness, and the other is truancy. That is staying away from school without permission. Since school officials can’t do much about the illness, they are concentrating on reducing the number of truancy. One of the most promising schemes has been tried in Florida. The pupils there with good attendance have been given free hamburgers, toys and T-shirts. Classes are told if they show improved rates of attendance, they can win additional gifts. At the same time, teachers are encouraged to inspire their students to come to school regularly. When those teachers are successful, they are also rewarded. “we’ve been punishing truancy for years, but that hasn’t brought them back to school,” One school principal said. Now we are trying the positive approach. Not only do you learn by showing up every day, but you earn. In San Francisco, the board of education has had a somewhat similar idea. Schools that show a decrease in deliberate destruction of property can receive the amount of money that would be spent on repairs and replacements. For example, 12,000 dollars had been set aside for a school’s property damages every year. Since repair expenses of damaged property required only 4,000 dollars, the remaining 8,000 dollars was turned over to the student activity fund. “Our democracy operates on hope and encouragement,” said the school board member. “Why not provide some positive goals for students and teachers to aim at?”
Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18. Which reason for students’ absences is discussed in great detail?
19. Who will benefit from the scheme being tried in Florida?
20. What measure has been taken in San Francisco to reduce the destruction of school property?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
There are good reasons to be troubled by the violence that spreads throughout the media. Movies, Television and video games are full of gunplay and bloodshed, and one might reasonably ask what’s wrong with a society that presents videos of domestic violence as entertainment.
Most researchers agree that the causes of real-world violence are complex. A 1993 study by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences listed “biological, individual, family, peer, school, and community factors” as all playing their parts.
Viewing abnormally large amounts of violent television and video games may well contribute to violent behavior in certain individuals. The trouble comes when researchers downplay uncertainties in their studies or overstate the case for causality (因果关系). Skeptics were dismayed several years ago when a group of societies including the American Medical Association tried to end the debate by issuing a joint statement: “At this time, well over 1,000 studies... point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children.”
Freedom-of-speech advocates accused the societies of catering to politicians, and even disputed the number of studies (most were review articles and essays, they said). When Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the University of Toronto, reviewed the literature, he found only 200 or so studies of television-watching and aggression. And when he weeded out “the most doubtful measures of aggression”, only 28% supported a connection.
The critical point here is causality. The alarmists say they have proved that violent media cause aggression. But the assumptions behind their observations need to be examined. When labeling games as violent or non-violent, should a hero eating a ghost really be counted as a violent event? And when experimenters record the time it takes game players to read ‘aggressive’ or ‘non-aggressive’ words from a list, can we be sure what they are actually measuring? The intent of the new Harvard Center on Media and Child Health to collect and standardize studies of media violence in order to compare their methodologies, assumptions and conclusions is an important step in the right direction.
Another appropriate step would be to tone down the criticism until we know more. Several researchers write, speak and testify quite a lot on the threat posed by violence in the media. That is, of course, their privilege. But when doing so, they often come out with statements that the matter has now been settled, drawing criticism from colleagues. In response, the alarmists accuse critics and news reporters of being deceived by the entertainment industry. Such clashes help neither science nor society.
21. Why is there so much violence shown in movies, TV and video games?
A) There is a lot of violence in the real world today.
B) Something has gone wrong with today’s society.
C) Many people are fond of gunplay and bloodshed.
D) Showing violence is thought to be entertaining.
22. What is the skeptics (Line 3. Para. 3) view of media violence?
A) Violence on television is a fairly accurate reflection of real-world life.
B) Most studies exaggerate the effect of media violence on the viewers.
C) A causal relationship exists between media and real-world violence.
D) The influence of media violence on children has been underestimated.
23. The author uses the term “alarmists” (Line 1. Para. 5) to refer to those who ________.
A) use standardized measurements in the studies of media violence
B) initiated the debate over the influence of violent media on reality
C) assert a direct link between violent media and aggressive behavior
D) use appropriate methodology in examining aggressive behavior
24. In refuting the alarmists, the author advances his argument by first challenging ________.
A) the source and amount of their data
B) the targets of their observation
C) their system of measurement
D) their definition of violence
25. What does the author think of the debate concerning the relationship between the media and violence?
A) More studies should be conducted before conclusions are drawn.
B) It should come to an end since the matter has now been settled.
C) The past studies in this field have proved to be misleading.
D) He more than agrees with the views held by the alarmists.
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
You’re in trouble if you have to buy your own brand-name prescription drugs. Over the past decade, prices leaped by more than double the inflation rate. Treatments for chronic conditions can easily top $2,000 a month-no wonder that one in four Americans can’s afford to fill their prescriptions. The solution? A hearty chorus of “O Canada.” North of the border, where price controls reign, those same brand-name drugs cost 50% to 80% less.
The Canadian option is fast becoming a political wake-up call, “If our neighbors can buy drugs at reasonable prices, why can’t we? Even to whisper that thought provokes anger. “Un-American!” And-the propagandists’ trump card (王牌)―“Wreck our brilliant health-care system.” Supersize drug prices, they claim, fund the research that sparks the next generation of wonder drugs. No sky-high drug price today, no cure for cancer tomorrow. So shut up and pay up.
Common sense tells you that’s a false alternative. The reward for finding, say, a cancer cure is so huge that no one’s going to hang it up. Nevertheless, if Canada-level pricing came to the United States, the industry’s profit margins would drop and the pace of new-drug development would slow. Here lies the American dilemma. Who is all this splendid medicine for? Should our health-care system continue its drive toward the best of the best, even though rising numbers of patients can’t afford it? Or should we direct our wealth toward letting everyone in on today’s level of care? Measured by saved lives, the latter is almost certainly the better course.
To defend their profits, the drug companies have warned Canadian wholesalers and pharmacies (药房) not to sell to Americans by mail, and are cutting back supplies to those who dare.
Meanwhile, the administration is playing the fear card. Officials from the Food and Drug Administration will argue that Canadian drugs might be fake, mishandled, or even a potential threat to life.
Do bad drugs fly around the Internet? Sure-and the more we look, the more we’ll find, But I haven’t heard of any raging epidemics among the hundreds of thousands of people buying crossborder.
Most users of prescription drugs don’t worry about costs a lot. They’re sheltered by employee insurance, owing just a $20 co-pay. The financial blows rain, instead, on the uninsured, especially the chronically ill who need expensive drugs to live, This group will still include middle-income seniors on Medicare, who’ll have to dig deeply into their pockets before getting much from the new drug benefit that starts in 2006.
26. What is said about the consequence of the rocketing drug prices in the U.S.?
A) A quarter of Americans can’t afford their prescription drugs.
B) Many Americans can’t afford to see a doctor when they fall ill.
C) Many Americans have to go to Canada to get medical treatment.
D) The inflation rate has been more than doubled over the years.
27. It can be inferred that America can follow the Canadian model and curb its soaring drug prices by ________.
A) encouraging people to buy prescription drugs online
B) extending medical insurance to all its citizens
C) importing low-price prescription drugs from Canada
D) exercising price control on brand-name drugs
28. How do propagandists argue for the U.S. drug pricing policy?
A) Low prices will affect the quality of medicines in America.
B) High prices are essential to funding research on new drugs.
C) Low prices will bring about the anger of drug manufacturers.
D) High-price drugs are indispensable in curing chronic diseases.
29. What should be the priority of America’s health-care system according to the author?
A) To resolve the dilemma in the health-care system.
B) To maintain America’s lead in the drug industry.
C) To allow the vast majority to enjoy its benefits.
D) To quicken the pace of new drug development.
30. What are American drug companies doing to protect their high profits?
A) Labeling drugs bought from Canada as being fakes.
B) Threatening to cut back funding for new drug research.
C) Reducing supplies to uncooperative Canadian pharmacies.
D) Attributing the raging epidemics to the ineffectiveness of Canadian drugs.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Age has its privileges in America. And one of the more prominent of them is the senior citizen discount. Anyone who has reached a certain age―in some cases as low as 55―is automatically entitled to a dazzling array of price reductions at nearly every level of commercial life. Eligibility is determined not by one’s need but by the date on one’s birth certificate. Practically unheard of a generation ago, the discounts have become a routine part of many businesses―as common as color televisions in motel rooms and free coffee on airliners.
People with gray hair often are given the discounts without even asking for them；yet, millions of Americans above age 60 are healthy and solvent (有支付能力的). Businesses that would never dare offer discounts to college students or anyone under 30 freely offer them to older Americans. The practice is acceptable because of the widespread belief that “elderly” and “needy” are synonymous (同义的). Perhaps that once was true, but today elderly Americans as a group have a lower poverty rate than the rest of the population. To be sure, there is economic diversity within the elderly, and many older Americans are poor, But most of them aren’t.
It is impossible to determine the impact of the discounts on individual companies. For many firms, they are a stimulus to revenue. But in other cases the discounts are given at the expense, directly or indirectly, of younger Americans. Moreover, they are a direct irritant in what some politicians and scholars see as a coming conflict between the generations.
Generational tensions are being fueled by continuing debate over Social Security benefits, which mostly involves a transfer of resources from the young to the old. Employment is another sore point, Buoyed (支持) by laws and court decisions, more and more older Americans are declining the retirement dinner in favor of staying on the job-thereby lessening employment and promotion opportunities for younger workers.
Far from a kind of charity they once were, senior citizen discounts have become a formidable economic privilege to a group with millions of members who don’t need them.
It no longer makes sense to treat the elderly as a single group whose economic needs deserve priority over those of others. Senior citizen discounts only enhance the myth that older people can’t take care of themselves and need special treatment； and they threaten the creation of a new myth, that the elderly are ungrateful and taking for themselves at the expense of children and other age groups. Senior citizen discounts are the essence of the very thing older Americans are fighting against-discrimination by age.
31. We learn from the first paragraph that ________.
A) offering senior citizens discounts has become routine commercial practice
B) senior citizen discounts have enabled many old people to live a decent life
C) giving senior citizens discounts has boosted the market for the elderly
D) senior citizens have to show their birth certificates to get a discount
32. What assumption lies behind the practice of senior citizen discounts?
A) Businesses, having made a lot of profits, should do something for society in return.
B) Old people are entitled to special treatment for the contribution they made to society.
C) The elderly, being financially underprivileged, need humane help from society.
D) Senior citizen discounts can make up for the inadequacy of the Social Security system.
33. According to some politicians and scholars, senior citizen discounts will ________.
A) make old people even more dependent on society
B) intensify conflicts between the young and the old
C) have adverse financial impact on business companies
D) bring a marked increase in the companies revenues
34. How does the author view the Social Security system?
A) It encourages elderly people to retire in time.
B) It opens up broad career prospects for young people.
C) It benefits the old at the expense of the young.
D) It should be reinforced by laws and court decisions.
35. Which of the following best summarizes the author’s main argument?
A) Senior citizens should fight hard against age discrimination.
B) The elderly are selfish and taking senior discounts for granted.
C) Priority should be given to the economic needs of senior citizens.
D) Senior citizen discounts may well be a type of age discrimination.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
In 1854 my great-grandfather, Morris Marable, was sold on an auction block in Georgia for $500. For his white slave master, the sale was just “business as usual.” But to Morris Marable and his heirs, slavery was a crime against our humanity. This pattern of human rights violations against enslaved African-Americans continued under racial segregation for nearly another century.
The fundamental problem of American democracy in the 21st century is the problem of “structural racism” the deep patterns of socio-economic inequality and accumulated disadvantage that are coded by race, and constantly justified in public speeches by both racist stereotypes and white indifference. Do Americans have the capacity and vision to remove these structural barriers that deny democratic rights and opportunities to millions of their fellow citizens?
This country has previously witnessed two great struggles to achieve a truly multicultural democracy.
The First Reconstruction (1865-1877) ended slavery and briefly gave black men voting rights, but gave no meaningful compensation for two centuries of unpaid labor. The promise of “40 acres and a mule (骡子)”was for most blacks a dream deferred (尚未实现的).
The Second Reconstruction (1954-1968), or the modern civil rights movement, ended legal segregation in public accommodations and gave blacks voting rights. But these successes paradoxically obscure the tremendous human costs of historically accumulated disadvantage that remain central to black Americans’ lives.
The disproportionate wealth that most whites enjoy today was first constructed from centuries of unpaid black labor. Many white institutions, including some leading universities, insurance companies and banks, profited from slavery. This pattern of white privilege and black inequality continues today.
Demanding reparations (赔偿) is not just about compensation for slavery and segregation. It is, more important, an educational campaign to highlight the contemporary reality of “racial deficits” of all kinds, the unequal conditions that impact blacks regardless of class. Structural racism’s barriers include “equity inequity.” the absence of black capital formation that is a direct consequence of America’s history. One third of all black households actually have negative net wealth. In 1998 the typical black family’s net wealth was $16,400, less than one fifth that of white families. Black families are denied home loans at twice the rate of whites.
Blacks remain the last hired and first fired during recessions. During the 1990-91 recession, African-Americans suffered disproportionately. At Coca-Cola, 42 percent of employees who lost their jobs were blacks. At Sears, 54 percent were black, Blacks have significantly shorter life spans, in part due to racism in the health establishment. Blacks are statistically less likely than whites to be referred for kidney transplants or early-stage cancer surgery.

A) crime against humanity
B) unfair business transaction
C) racial conflicts in Georgia
D) racial segregation in America

Until recently, dyslexia and other reading problems were a mystery to most teachers and parents. As a result, too many kids passed through school without master the printed page. (S1) Some were treated as mentally deficient: many were left functionally illiterate (文盲的)，unable to ever meet their potential. But in the last several years, there’s been a revolution in that we’ve learned about reading and dyslexia. (S2) Scientists are using a variety of new imaging techniques to watch the brain at work. Their experiments have shown that reading disorders are most likely the result of what is, in an effect, (S3) faulty wiring in the brain―not lazy, stupidity or a poor home (S4) environment. There’s also convincing evidence which dyslexia (S5) is largely inherited. It is now considered a chronic problem for some kids, not just a “phase”. Scientists have also discarded another old stereotype that almost all dyslexics are boys. Studies indicate that many girls are affecting as well (S6) and not getting help.
At same time, educational researchers have come up (S7) with innovative teaching strategies for kids who are having trouble learning to read. New screening tests are identifying children at risk before they get discouraged by year of (S8) frustration and failure. And educators are trying to get the message to parents that they should be on the alert for the first signs of potential problems.
It’s an urgent mission. Mass literacy is a relative new (S9) social goal. A hundred years ago people didn’t need to be good readers in order to earn a living. But in the Information Age, no one can get by with knowing how to read well and (S10) understand increasingly complex material.

Space Tourism
Make your reservations now. The space tourism industry is officially open for business, and tickets are going for a mere $20 million for a one-week stay in space. Despite reluctance from National Air and Space Administration (NASA)，Russia made American businessman Dennis Tito the world’s first space tourist. Tito flew into space aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket that arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on April 30, 2001. The second space tourist, South African businessman Mark Shuttleworth, took off aboard the Russian Soyuz on April 25, 2002, also bound for the ISS.
Lance Bass of ‘N Sync was supposed to be the third to make the $20 million trip, but he did not join the three-man crew as they blasted off on October 30, 2002, due to lack of payment. Probably the most incredible aspect of this proposed space tour was that NASA approved of it.
These trips are the beginning of what could be a profitable 21st century industry. There are already several space tourism companies planning to build suborbital vehicles and orbital cities within the next two decades. These companies have invested millions, believing that the space tourism industry is on the verge of taking off.
In 1997, NASA published a report concluding that selling trips into space to private citizens could be worth billions of dollars. A Japanese report supports these findings, and projects that space tourism could be a $10 billion per year industry within the next two decades. The only obstacles to opening up space to tourists are the space agencies, who are concerned with safety and the development of a reliable, reusable launch vehicle.
Space Accommodations
Russia’s Mir space station was supposed to be the first destination for space tourists. But in March 2001，the Russian Aerospace Agency brought Mir down into the Pacific Ocean. As it turned out, bringing down Mir only temporarily delayed the first tourist trip into space.
The Mir crash did cancel plans for a new reality-based game show from NBC, which was going to be called Destination Mir. The Survivor-like TV show was scheduled to air in fall 2001, Participants on the show were to go through training at Russia’s cosmonaut (宇航员) training center, Star City. Each week, one of the participants would be eliminated from the show, with the winner receiving a trip to the Mir space station. The Mir crash has ruled out NBC’s space plans for now. NASA is against beginning space tourism until the International Space Station is completed in 2006.
Russia is not alone in its interest in space tourism. There are several projects underway to commercialize space travel. Here are a few of the groups that might take tourists to space:
l Space Island Group is going to build a ring-shaped, rotating “commercial space infrastructure (基础结构)” that will resemble the Discovery spacecraft in the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Space Island says it will build its space city out of empty NASA space-shuttle fuel tanks (to start, it should take around 12 or so), and place it about 400 miles above Earth. The space city will rotate once per minute to create a gravitational pull one-third as strong as Earth’s.
l According to their vision statement. Space Adventures plans to “fly tens of thousand of people in space over the next 10-15 years and beyond, around the moon, and back, from spaceports both on Earth and in space, to and from private space stations, and board dozen of different vehicles...”
l Even Hilton Hotels has shown interest in the space tourism industry and possibility of building or co-funding a space hotel. However, the company did say that it believes such a space hotel is 15 to 20 years away.
Initially, space tourism will offer simple accommodations at best. For instance, if the International Space Station is used as a tourist attraction, guests won’t find the luxurious surroundings of a hotel room on Earth. It has been designed for conducting research, not entertainment. However, the first generation of space hotels should offer tourists a much more comfortable experience.
In regard to a concept for a space hotel initially planned by Space Island, such a hotel could offer guests every convenience they might find at a hotel on Earth, and some they might not. The small gravitational pull created by the rotating space city would allow space-tourists and residents to walk around and function facilities would be possible. Additionally, space tourists would even be able to take space walks.
Many of these companies believe that they have to offer an extremely enjoyable experience in order for passengers to pay thousands, if not millions, of dollars to ride into space. So will space create another separation between the haves and have-nots?
The Most Expensive Vacation
Will space be an exotic retreat reserved for only the wealthy? Or will middle-class folks have a chance to take their families to space? Make no mistake about it, going to space will be the most expensive vacation you ever take. Prices right now are in the tens of millions of dollars. Currently, the only vehicles that can take you into space are the space shuttle and the Russian Soyuz, both of which are terribly inefficient. Each spacecraft requires millions of pounds of fuel to take off into space, which makes them expensive to launch. One pound of payload (有效载重) costs about $10,000 to put into Earth’s orbit.
NASA and Lockheed Martin are currently developing a single-stage-to-orbit launch space plane, called the VentureStar, that could be launched for about a tenth of what the space shuttle costs to launch. If the VentureStar takes off, the number of people who could afford to take a trip into space would move into the millions.
In 1998, a joint report from NASA and the Space Transportation Association stated that improvements in technology could push fares for space travel as low as $50,000, and possibly down to $20,000 or $10,000 a decade later. The report concluded that a ticket price of $50,000, there could be 500,000 passengers flying into space each year. While still leaving out many people, these prices would open up space to a tremendous amount of traffic.
Since the beginning of the space race, the general public has said, “Isn’t that great―when do I get to go?” Well, our chance might be closer than ever. Within the next 20 years, space planes could be taking off for the Moon at the same frequency as airplanes flying between New York and Los Angles.

Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
I’ve heard from and talked to many people who described how Mother Nature simplified their lives for them. They’d lost their home and many or all of their possessions through fires, floods, earthquakes, or some other disaster. Losing everything you own under such circumstances can be distressing, but the people I’ve heard from all saw their loss, ultimately as a blessing.
“The fire saved us the agony of deciding what to keep and what to get rid of,” one woman wrote. And once all those things were no longer there, she and her husband saw how they had weighed them down and complicate their lives.
“There was so much stuff we never used and that was just taking up space. We vowed when we started over, we’d replace only what we needed, and this time we’d do it right. We’ve kept our promise: we don’t have much now, but what we have is exactly what we want.”
Though we’ve never had a catastrophic loss such as that, Gibbs and I did have a close call shortly before we decided to simplify. At that time we lived in a fire zone. One night a firestorm rages through and destroyed over six hundred homes in our community. That tragedy gave us the opportunity to look objectively at the goods we’d accumulated.
We saw that there was so much we could get rid of and only never miss, but be better off without. Having almost lost it all, we found it much easier to let go of the things we knew we’d never use again.
Obviously, there’s a tremendous difference between getting rid of possessions and losing them through a natural disaster without having a say in the matter. And this is not to minimize the tragedy and pain such a loss can generate.
But you might think about how you would approach the acquisition process if you had it to do all over again. Look around your home and make a list of what you would replace.
Make another list of things you wouldn’t acquire again no matter what, and in fact would be happy to be rid of.
When you’re ready to start unloading some of your stuff, that list will be a good place to start.

47. Many people whose possessions were destroyed in natural disasters eventually considered their loss ________.
48. Now that all their possessions were lost in the fire, the woman and her husband felt that their lives had been ________.

50. According to the author, getting rid of possessions and losing them through a natural disaster are vastly ________.
51. What does the author suggest people do with unnecessary things?
Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C), and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
In a purely biological sense, fear begins with the body’s system for reacting to things that can harm us―the so-called fight-or-flight response. “An animal that can’t detect danger can’t stay alive,” says Joseph LeDoux. Like animals, humans evolved with an elaborate mechanism for processing information about potential threats. At its core is a cluster of neurons (神经元) deep in the brain known as the amygdale (扁桃核).
LeDoux studies the way animals and humans respond to threats to understand how we form memories of significant events in our lives. The amygdale receives input from many parts of the brain, including regions responsible for retrieving memories. Using this information, the amygdale appraises a situation―I think this charging dog wants to bite me―and triggers a response by radiating nerve signals throughout the body. These signals produce the familiar signs of distress: trembling, perspiration and fast-moving feet, just to name three.
This fear mechanism is critical to the survival of all animals, but no one can say for sure whether beasts other than humans know they’re afraid. That is, as LeDoux says, “if you put that system into a brain that has consciousness, then you get the feeling of fear.”
Humans, says Edward M. Hallowell, have the ability to call up images of bad things that happened in the past and to anticipate future events. Combine these higher thought processes with our hardwired danger-detection systems, and you get a near-universal human phenomenon: worry.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing, says Hallowell. “When used properly, worry is an incredible device,” he says. After all, a little healthy worrying is okay if it leads to constructive action―like having a doctor look at that weird spot on your back.
Hallowell insists, though, that there’s a right way to worry. “Never do it alone, get the facts and then make a plan.” He says. Most of us have survived a recession, so we’re familiar with the belt-tightening strategies needed to survive a slump.
Unfortunately, few of us have much experience dealing with the threat of terrorism, so it’s been difficult to get fact about how we should respond. That’s why Hallowell believes it was okay for people to indulge some extreme worries last fall by asking doctors for Cipro (抗炭疽菌的药物) and buying gas masks.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
Amitai Etzioni is not surprised by the latest headings about scheming corporate crooks (骗子). As a visiting professor at the Harvard Business School in 1989, he ended his work there disgusted with his students’ overwhelming lost for money. “They’re taught that profit is all that matters,” he says. “Many schools don’t even offer ethics (伦理学) courses at all.”
Etzioni expressed his frustration about the interests of his graduate students. “By and large, I clearly had not found a way to help classes full of MBAs see that there is more to life than money, power, fame and self-interest.” He wrote at the time. Today he still takes the blame for not educating these “business-leaders-to-be.” “I really like I failed them,” he says. “If I was a better teacher maybe I could have reached them.”
Etzioni was a respected ethics expert when he arrived at Harvard. He hoped his work at the university would give him insight into how questions of morality could be applied to places where self-interest flourished. What he found wasn’t encouraging. Those would be executives had, says Etzioni, little interest in concepts of ethics and morality in the boardroom―and their professor was met with blank stares when he urged his students to see business in new and different ways.
Etzioni sees the experience at Harvard as an eye-opening one and says there’s much about business schools that he’d like to change. “A lot of the faculty teaching business are bad news themselves,” Etzioni says. From offering classes that teach students how to legally manipulate contracts, to reinforcing the notion of profit over community interests, Etzioni has seen a lot that’s left him shaking his head. And because of what he’s seen taught in business schools, he’s not surprised by the latest rash of corporate scandals. “In many ways things have got a lot worse at business schools, I suspect,” says Etzioni.
Etzioni is still teaching the sociology of right and wrong and still calling for ethical business leadership. “People with poor motives will always exist.” He says. “Sometimes environments constrain those people and sometimes environments give those people opportunity.” Etzioni says the booming economy of the last decade enabled those individuals with poor motives to get rich before getting in trouble.

Example:
Television is rapidly becoming the literature of our periodsu. 1. time/times/period
Many of the arguments havingu used for the study of literature as 2. _______\_______
a school subject are valid for ∧ study of television. 3. ______the______
The National Endowment for the Arts recently released the results of its “Reading at Risk” survey, which described the movement of the American public away from books and literature and toward television and electronic media. According to the survey, “reading is on the decline on every (62) region, within every ethnic group, and at every educational level.”
The day the NEA report released, the U.S. House, in a tie (63) Vote, upheld the government’s right to obtain bookstore and library records under a provision of the USA Patriot Act. The House proposal would have barred the federal government (64) from demand library records, reading lists, book customer lists and other material in terrorism and intelligence investigations.
These two events are completely unrelated to, yet they (65) echo each other in the message they send about the place of books and reading in American culture. At the heart (66) of the NEA survey is the belief in our democratic System depends on leaders who can think critically, analyze (67) texts and discussing books and literature. At the same time, through a provision of the Patriot Act, the leaders of our country are unconsciously sending the message that reading (68) may be connected to desirable activities that might undermine our system of government rather than helping democracy flourish.
Our culture’s decline in reading begin well before the (69) existence of the Patriot Act. During the 1980s’ culture wars, school systems across the country pulled some books from (70) library shelves because its content was deemed by parents and teachers to be inappropriate. Now what started in schools across the country is playing itself out on a nation stage and (71) is possibly having an impact on the reading habits of the American public.

听力原文
11. W: I need to find a dentist; you said you know Dr. Smith well, do you recommend her?
M: Well, I had to see her a few times, but what impressed me most were the magazines in her waiting room.
Q: What does the woman imply?
12. W: I’m afraid I can’t show you the apartment at the moment, because the tenant is still living in it. It’s really a lovely place, with a big kitchen and a sunny window, for only two hundred dollars a month.
M: Sounds good, but we really can’t rent an apartment without seeing it first.
Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
13. M: So, that’s what’s been keeping you so busy recently!
W: Yes, I’ve been tied up with my studies. You know I’m planning to go to the United States this coming summer, but I’m a bit nervous about my English.
Q: What is the woman busy doing?
14. W: How did you feel when you found out you had high blood pressure?
M: Shocked! The problem for me was that there were no symptoms; it seemed to have sneaked up on me.
Q: What does the man mean?
15. W: So, you’re just back from a trip to India. What were you doing there?
M: The trip was intended to bring to the world’s attention the fact that AIDS is not just an African disease; it’s also endangering other countries, notably, India and Thailand.
Q: What was the purpose of the man’s trip to India?
16. M: It’s quite clear form my visit, this is a full size, comprehensive university. So why is it still called a college?
W: The College of William and Mary is the second oldest institution of higher learning in this country. We have nurtured great minds like Thomas Jefferson and we are proud of our name.
Q: What do we learn from this conversation about the College of William and Mary?
17. M: Have the parts we need for the photo copying machine arrived yet?
W: I ordered them last week, but something is holding them up.
Q: What does the woman say about the parts needed for the photo copying machine?

Conversation One
W: Hello, Patrick, is that you?
M: Yeah Jane, what can I do for you?
W: I was calling about the apple tree that you were trimming yesterday.
M: That was hard work!
W: I’m sure it was. It sure looked difficult.
M: Yeah, I’m glad it’s finished. Hauling the branches to the front for garbage pick up was no fun either.
W: Well, I don’t think you’re quite finished yet, some of the larger branches fell over into my yard, and I think you should come and get them.
M: Listen Jane, I don’t see why I should do that. You eat all the apples that fall in your yard and you’ve never complained about that before.
W: Well, it’s easier to pick up apples then to drag tree branches all the way to the curb. My kids pick up the apples, and the branches are just too big for them to drag.
M: Well, I guess you’ll just have to do it yourself Jane.
W: Patrick, I wish you would reconsider. We’ve always gotten along fairly well, but I think you’re out of line here. The branches are your responsibility.
M: Sorry Jane, I disagree! You take the benefits of the apple tree, but refuse to deal with the bad side of it! Besides, it won’t take you any time to get the branches out front!
W: Get the branches off my property or I’ll have to sue you.
M: Yeah? For what?! You’re taking those law classes too seriously! I’ve gotta go, I have to pick up my son.
W: You’ll be hearing from me.
M: Yeah, yeah. See you in court Jane.
Questions 19-22 are based on the questions you have just heard.
19. What did the man do yesterday?
20. What did the woman ask the man to do?

Conversation Two
M: Did you hear about the air crash that occurred in South America recently? It was quite a tragic accident!
W: No, I didn’t see anything in the news about it. What happened?
M: A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill!
W: That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive?
M: No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly.
W: What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure?
M: Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers.
W: Weren’t they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language?
M: Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction.
W: How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident?
M: The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That’s a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet.
W: So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.
M: Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.
W: Wow, that’s a powerful lesson on how important it can be to accurately communicate to each other.
Questions: 23-25 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
23. What was the cause of the tragedy?
24. How high are the mountains in Norweija?

Passage one
Edgar Poe, an American writer, was born in 1809. His parents were actors. Edgar was a baby when his father left the family. He was two years old when his mother died. He was taken into the home of a wealthy business man named John Allen. He then received his real name, Edgar Allen Poe. As a young man, Poe attended the University of Virginia. He was a good student, but he liked to drink alcohol and play card games for money. As an unskilled game player, he often lost money. Since he couldn’t pay off his gambling money, he left university and began working for magazines. He worked hard, yet he was not well paid, or well known. At the age of 27, he got married. For a time it seemed that Poe would find happiness, but his wife was sick for most of their marriage, and died in 1847. Through all his crises, Poe produced many stories and poems which appeared in different publications, yet he didn’t become famous until 1845, when his poem, The Raven, was published. There is a question, however, about Poe’s importance in American Literature. Some critics say that Poe was one of America’s best writers, and even influenced many French writers, but others disagree. They say that Poe’s work is difficult to understand and most of his writing describes many unpleasant situations and events. Edgar Allen Poe died in 1849 when he was 40 years old. It is said that he was found dead after days of heavy drinking.
Questions 26-29 are based on the passage you have just heard.

Passage Two
More than fifty years ago, the United Nations declared that literacy is a basic human right. It’s very important for improving the lives of individuals, however, it is estimated that 880 million adults around the world are illiterate, that is, they are unable to read or write. A majority of them are women. Over 100 million school age children around the world do not attend school. Many others complete school of fail to finish their studies without learning to read or write. Many countries depend on the efforts of people who offer their time to help illiterate individuals. For example, John Mogger became concerned about the problem of illiteracy three years ago, so he started teaching five prisoners in Brazil. In his teaching, he developed a system with these prisoners. He says his way of teaching can help anyone learn how to read and write with about thirty hours of study. To learn his system, people must first know how to write letters of the alphabet and learn which sounds they represent. The system divides letters into three groups. The first group of letter can be written between two lines. The second can be written between two lines but part of the letter is above the top line. The third group has letters that are partly written below the lower line. John Mogger taught his students to write simply words from the letters, in this way, his students learned more than seven hundred words. Many of them can now write to family members. They also can read newspapers and magazines.
Questions 30-32 are based on the Passage you have just heard.
30. According to the speaker, which group of people makes up the majority of the illiterate population?
31. What is the most important feature of John Moggers method of teaching the alphabet?
32. What does John Mogger say about his teaching method?
Passage Three
Farmers usually use plows to prepare their fields for planting crops. Plows cut into the ground, and lift up weeds, and other unwanted plants. However, plowing is blamed for causing severe damage to top soil by removing the plants that protect soil from being blown or washed away. Many farmers in South Asia are now trying a process called Low Till Farming. Low Till Farming limits the use of plows. In this method of farming seeds and fertilizer are put into the soil through small cuts made in the surface of the ground. Low Till Agriculture leaves much or all the soil and remains of plants on the ground. They serve as a natural fertilizer and help support the roots of future crops. They take in rain and allow it to flow into the soil instead of running off. It has been proved that Low Till Farming increases harvests and reduces water use, and this method reduced the need for chemical products because there are fewer unwanted plants. Scientists say Low Till Farming is becoming popular in South Asia, which is facing a sever water shortage. They say the area will become depended on imported food unless water is saved through methods like Low Till Farming. Currently, more than 150 million people in South Asia depend on local rice and wheat crops. Farmers grow rice during wet weather. During the dry season they grow wheat in the same fields. Farmers are using the Low Till method to plant wheat after harvesting rice. Scientists say Low Till Agriculture is one of the best examples in the worlds of technologies working for both people, and the environment.
Questions 33-35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
33. What is the main problem cause by the usual way of plowing?
34. What does the speaker say about Low Till Farming?
35. Where is Low Till Farming becoming popular?
Passage One
Adults are getting smarter about how smart babies are. Not long ago, researches learned that four day olds could understand addition and subtraction. Now, British research psychologist Gram Shaffer has discovered that infants can learn words or uncommon things long before they can speak. He found that nine month old infants could be taught through repeated show and tell to recognize the names of objects that were foreign to them, a result that challenges in some ways, the received wisdom that apart from learning to identify things common to their daily lives, children don’t being to build vocabulary until well into their second year. “It’s no secret that children learn words, but the words they tend to know are linked to specific situations in the home,” explains Shaffer. This is the first demonstration that we can choose what words the children will learn and that they can respond to them with an unfamiliar voice giving instructions in an unfamiliar setting. “Figuring out how human acquire language may shed light on why some children learn to read and write later than others,” Shaffer says, “and could lead to better treatments for developed mental problems.” What’s more, the study of language acquisition offers direct insight into how humans learn. “Language is a test case for human cognitive development,” says Shaffer, “but parents eager to teach their infants should take note. Even without being taught new words a control group caught up with the other infants within a few months.” This is not about advancing development, he says, it’s just about what children can do at an earlier age than what educators have often thought.

Seven Steps to a More Fulfilling Job
Many people today find themselves in unfulfilling work situations. In fact, one in four workers is dissatisfied with their current job, according to the recent “Plans for 2004” survey. Their career path may be financially rewarding, but it doesn’t meet their emotional, social or creative needs. They’re stuck, unhappy, and have no idea what to do about it, except move to another job.
Mary Lyn Miller, veteran career consultant and founder of the Life and Career Clinic, says that when most people are unhappy about their work, their first thought is to get a different job. Instead, Miller suggests looking at the possibility of a different life. Through her book, 8 Myths of Making a Living, as well as workshops, seminars and personal coaching and consulting, she has helped thousands of dissatisfied workers reassess life and work.
Like the way of Zen, which includes understanding of oneself as one really is, Miller encourages job seekers and those dissatisfied with work or life to examine their beliefs about work and recognize that “in many cases your beliefs are what brought you to where you are today.” You may have been raised to think that women were best at nurturing and caring and, therefore, should be teachers and nurses. So that’s what you did. Or, perhaps you were brought up to believe that you should do what your father did, so you have taken over the family business, or become a dentist “just like dad.” If this sounds familiar, it’s probably time to look at the new possibilities for your future.
Miller developed a 7-step process to help potential job seekers assess their current situation and beliefs, identify their real passion, and start on a journey that allows them to pursue their passion through work.
Step 1: Willingness to do something different.
Breaking the cycle of doing what you have always done is one of the most difficult tasks for job seekers. Many find it difficult to steer away from a career path or make a change, even if it doesn’t feel right. Miller urges job seekers to open their minds to other possibilities beyond what they are currently doing.
Step 2: Commitment to being who you are, not who or what someone wants you to be.
Look at the \gifts and talents you have and make a commitment to pursue those things that you love most. If you love the social aspects of your job, but are stuck inside an office or “chained to your desk” most of the time, vow to follow your instinct and investigate alternative careers and work that allow you more time to interact with others. Dawn worked as a manager for a large retail clothing store for several years. Though she had advanced within the company, she felt frustrated and longed to be involved with nature and the outdoors. She decided to go to school nights and weekends to pursue her true passion by earning her master’s degree in forestry. She now works in the biotech forestry division of a major paper company.
Step 3: Self-definition
Miller suggests that once job seekers know who they are, they need to know how to sell themselves. “In the job market, you are a product. And just like a product, you most know the features and benefits that you have to offer a potential client, or employer.” Examine the skills and knowledge that you have identify how they can apply to your desired occupation. Your qualities will exhibit to employers why they should hire you over other candidates.
Step 4: Attain a level of self-honoring.
Self-honoring or self-love may seem like an odd step for job hunters, but being able to accept yourself, without judgment, helps eliminate insecurities and will make you more self-assured. By accepting who you are C all your emotions, hopes and dreams, your personality, and your unique way of being C you’ll project more confidence when networking and talking with potential employers. The power of self-honoring can help to break all the falsehoods you were programmed to believe C those that made you feel that you were not good enough, or strong enough, or intelligent enough to do what you truly desire.
Step 5: Vision.
Miller suggests that job seekers develop a vision that embraces the answer to “What do I really want to do?” one should create a solid statement in a dozen or so sentences that describe in detail how they see their life related to work. For instance, the secretary who longs to be an actress describes a life that allows her to express her love of Shakespeare on stage. A real estate agent, attracted to his current job because her loves fixing up old homes, describes buying properties that need a little tender loving care to make them more saleable.
Step 6: Appropriate risk.
Some philosophers believe that the way to enlightenment comes through facing obstacles and difficulties. Once people discover their passion, many are too scared to do anything about it. Instead, they do nothing. With this step, job seekers should assess what they are willing to give up, or risk, in pursuit of their dream. For one working mom, that meant taking night classes to learn new computer-aided design skills, while still earning a salary and keeping her day job. For someone else, it may mean quitting his or her job, taking out loan and going back to school full time. You’ll move one step closer to your ideal work life if you identify how much risk you are willing to take and the sacrifices you are willing to make.
Step 7: Action.
Some teachers of philosophy describe action in this way, “If one wants to get to the top of a mountain, just sitting at the foot thinking about it will not bring one there. It is by making the effort of climbing up the mountain, step by step, that eventually the summit is reached.” All too often, it is the lack of action that ultimately holds people back from attaining their ideals. Creating a plan and taking it one step at a time can lead to new and different job opportunities. Job-hunting tasks gain added meaning as you sense their importance in your quest for a more meaningful work life. The plan can include researching industries and occupations, talking to people who are in your desired area of work, taking classes, or accepting volunteer work in your targeted field.
Each of these steps will lead you on a journey to a happier and more rewarding work life. After all, it is the journey, not the destination, that is most important.

Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
Google is a world-famous company, with its headquarters in Mountain View, California. It was set up in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998, and inflated (膨胀) with the Internet bubble. Even when everything around it collapsed the company kept on inflating. Google’s search engine is so widespread across the world that search became Google, and google became a verb. The world fell in love with the effective, fascinatingly fast technology.
Google owes much of its success to the brilliance of S. Brin and L. Page, but also to a series of fortunate events. It was Page who, at Stanford in 1996, initiated the academic project that eventually became Google’s search engine. Brin, who had met Page at a student orientation a year earlier, joined the project early on. They were both Ph.D. candidates when they devised the search engine which was better than the rest and, without any marketing, spread by word of mouth from early adopters to, eventually, your grandmother.
Their breakthrough, simply put, was that when their search engine crawled the Web, it did more than just look for word matches, it also tallied (统计) and ranked a host of other critical factors like how websites link to one another. That delivered far better results than anything else. Brin and Page meant to name their creation Googol (the mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeroes), but someone misspelled the word so it stuck as Google. They raised money from prescient (有先见之明的) professors and venture capitalists, and moved off campus to turn Google into business. Perhaps their biggest stroke of luck came early on when they tried to sell their technology to other search engines, but no one met their price, and they built it up on their own.
The next breakthrough came in 2000, when Google figured out how to make money with its invention. It had lots of users, but almost no one was paying. The solution turned out to be advertising, and it’s not an exaggeration to say that Google is now essentially an advertising company, given that that’s the source of nearly all its revenue. Today it is a giant advertising company, worth $100 billion.

Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C), and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
You hear the refrain all the time: the U.S. economy looks good statistically, but it doesn’t feel good. Why doesn’t ever-greater wealth promote ever-greater happiness? It is a question that dates at least to the appearance in 1958 of The Affluent (富裕的) Society by John Kenneth Galbraith, who died recently at 97.
The Affluent Society is a modern classic because it helped define a new moment in the human condition. For most of history, “hunger, sickness, and cold” threatened nearly everyone, Galbraith wrote. “Poverty was found everywhere in that world. Obviously it is not of ours.” After World War II, the dread of another Great Depression gave way to an economic boom. In the 1930s unemployment had averaged 18.2 percent; in the 1950s it was 4.5 percent.
To Galbraith, materialism had gone mad and would breed discontent. Through advertising, companies conditioned consumers to buy things they didn’t really want or need. Because so much spending was artificial, it would be unfulfilling. Meanwhile, government spending that would make everyone better off was being cut down because people instinctively―and wrongly―labeled government only as “a necessary evil.”
It’s often said that only the rich are getting ahead; everyone else is standing still or falling behind. Well, there are many undeserving rich―overpaid chief executives, for instance. But over any meaningful period, most people’s incomes are increasing. From 1995 to 2004, inflation-adjusted average family income rose 14.3 percent, to $43,200. people feel “squeezed” because their rising incomes often don’t satisfy their rising wants―for bigger homes, more health care, more education, faster Internet connections.
The other great frustration is that it has not eliminated insecurity. People regard job stability as part of their standard of living. As corporate layoffs increased, that part has eroded. More workers fear they’ve become “the disposable American,” as Louis Uchitelle puts it in his book by the same name.
Because so much previous suffering and social conflict stemmed from poverty, the arrival of widespread affluence suggested utopian (乌托邦式的) possibilities. Up to a point, affluence succeeds. There is much les physical misery than before. People are better off. Unfortunately, affluence also creates new complaints and contradictions.
Advanced societies need economic growth to satisfy the multiplying wants of their citizens. But the quest for growth lets loose new anxieties and economic conflicts that disturb the social order. Affluence liberates the individual, promising that everyone can choose a unique way to self-fulfillment. But the promise is so extravagant that it predestines many disappointments and sometimes inspires choices that have anti-social consequences, including family breakdown and obesity (肥胖症). Statistical indicators of happiness have not risen with incomes.
Should we be surprised? Not really. We’ve simply reaffirmed an old truth: the pursuit of affluence does not always end with happiness.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
The use of deferential (敬重的) language is symbolic of the Confucian ideal of the woman, which dominates conservative gender norms in Japan. This ideal presents a woman who withdraws quietly to the background, subordinating her life and needs to those of her family and its male head. She is a dutiful daughter, wife, and mother, master of the domestic arts. The typical refined Japanese woman excels in modesty and delicacy; she “treads softly (谨言慎行)in the world,” elevating feminine beauty and grace to an art form.
Nowadays, it is commonly observed that young women are not conforming to the feminine linguistic (语言的) ideal. They are using fewer of the very deferential “women’s” forms, and even using the few strong forms that are know as “men’s.” This, of course, attracts considerable attention and has led to an outcry in the Japanese media against the defeminization of women’s language. Indeed, we didn’t hear about “men’s language” until people began to respond to girls’ appropriation of forms normally reserved for boys and men. There is considerable sentiment about the “corruption” of women’s language―which of course is viewed as part of the loss of feminine ideals and morality―and this sentiment is crystallized by nationwide opinion polls that are regularly carried out by the media.
Yoshiko Matsumoto has argued that young women probably never used as many of the highly deferential forms as older women. This highly polite style is no doubt something that young women have been expected to “grow into”―after all, it is assign not simply of femininity, but of maturity and refinement, and its use could be taken to indicate a change in the nature of one’s social relations as well. One might well imagine little girls using exceedingly polite forms when playing house or imitating older women―in a fashion analogous to little girls’ use of a high-pitched voice to do “teacher talk” or “mother talk” in role play.
The fact that young Japanese women are using less deferential language is a sure sign of change―of social change and of linguistic change. But it is most certainly not a sign of the “masculization” of girls. In some instances, it may be a sign that girls are making the same claim to authority as boys and men, but that is very different from saying that they are trying to be “masculine.” Katsue Reynolds has argued that girls nowadays are using more assertive language strategies in order to be able to compete with boys in schools and out. Social change also brings not simply different positions for women and girls, but different relations to life stages, and adolescent girls are participating in new subcultural forms. Thus what may, to an older speaker, seem like “masculine” speech may seem to an adolescent like “liberated” or “hip” speech.

11. W: Jim, you are on the net again? When are you going to get off? It’s the time for the talk show.
M: Just a minute, dear. I’m looking at a new jewelry site. I want to make sure I get the right gift for Mum’s birthday.
Q: What is the man doing right now?
12. W: I’ve never seen you have such confidence before an exam.
M: It’s more than confidence. Right now I feel that if I get less than an A, it’ll be the fault of the exam itself.
Q: What does the man mean?
13. W: Just look at this newspaper, nothing but murder, death and war! Do you still believe people are basically good?
M: Of course I do. But newspapers hardly ever report stories about peace and generosity. They are not news.
Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
14. M: Tom must be joking when he said he plans to sell his shop and go to medical school.
W: You are quite right. He is just kidding. He’s also told me time and time again he wished he’d studied for some profession instead of going into business.
Q: What will Tom probably do according to the conversation?
15. W: I hear your boss has a real good impression of you and he is thinking about giving you two more days off each month.
M: I hope not. I’d rather get more work hours so I can get enough bucks to help out my two kids at college.
Q: What does the man truly want?
16. M: I heard you took a trip to Mexico last month. How did you like it?
W: Oh, I got sick and tired of hotels and hotel food. So now I understand the saying, “East, west, home’s best”.
Q: What does the woman mean?
17. W: I’m worried about Anna. She is really been depressed lately. All she does is staying in her room all day.
M: That sounds serious. She’d better see a psychiatrist at the consoling center.
Q: What does the man suggest Anna do?
18. M: I could hardly recognize Sam after he got that new job. He’s always in a suit and a tie now.
W: Yeah, he was never like that at college. Back then he would’ve run in an old T-shirt and jeans.
Q: What do the speakers say about Sam?
Conversation One
M: Hi, Ann, welcome back. How’s your trip to the states?
W: Very busy. I had a lot of meetings. So, of course, I didn’t have much time to see New York.
M: What a pity. Actually I have a trip there myself next week.
W: Do you? Then take my advice. Do the well-being in the air program. It really works.
M: Oh, I read about that in a magazine. You say it works?
W: Yes. I did the program on the flight to the States. And when I arrived in New York, I didn’t have any problem. No jet leg at all. On the way back I didn’t do it, and I felt terrible.
M: You are joking.
W: Not at all. It really made a lot of difference.
M: Hmm…So, what did you do?
W: Well, I didn’t drink any alcohol or coffee and I didn’t eat any meat or rich food. I drink a lot of water and fruit juice and I eat the meals on the well-being menu. They are lighter. They have fish, vegetables and noodles, for example. And I did some of the exercises in the program.
M: Exercises? On a plane?
W: Yes. I didn’t do many, of course. There isn’t much space on the plane.
M: How many passengers did the exercises?
W: Not many.
M: And how much champagne did they drink?
W: A lot. It was more popular than mineral water.
M: So, basically it’s a choice. Mineral water and exercises or champagne and jet lag.
W: That’s right. It’s a difficult choice.
Questions 19 to 22 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
19. Why did the woman go to New York?
20. What does the woman say about the well-being in the air program?
21. What did the woman do to follow the well-being menu?
22. What did the woman say about other passengers?
Conversation Two
W: Morning. Can I help you?
M: Well, I’m not really sure. I’m just looking.
W: I see. Well, there’s plenty to look at again this year. I’m sure you’d have to walk miles to see each stand.
M: That’s true.
W: Would you like a coffee? Come and sit down for a minute. No obligation.
M: Well, that’s very kind of you. But…
W: No, please, is this the first year you’ve been to the fair, Mr. …?
M: Yes. Johnson. James Johnson.
W: My name’s Susan Carter. Are you looking for anything in particular or are you just interested in computers in general?
M: Well, actually, I have some specific jobs in mind. I own a small company. We’ve grown quite dramatically over the past 12 months and we really need some technological help to enable us to keep on top of everything.
W: What’s your line of business, Mr. Johnson?
M: We are a training consultancy.
W: I see. And what do you need to keep on top?
M: The first thing is correspondence. We have a lot f standard letters and forms. So I suppose we need some kind of word processor.
W: Right. Well, that’s no problem. But it may be possible for you to get a system that does a lot of other things in addition to word processing. What might suit you is the MR5000. That’s over there. It’s IBM compatible.
M: What about the price?
W: Well, the MR5000 costs 1,050 pounds. Software comes free with the hardware.
M: Well, I’ll think about it. Thank you.
W: Here’s my card. Please feel free to contact me.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
23. Where did the conversation take place?

25. What is the man’s line of business?
Passage One
The New Year always brings with it a cultural tradition of new possibilities. We see it as a chance for renewal. We begin to dream of new possible selves. We design our ideal self or an image that is quite different from what we are now. For some of us, we roll that dreamy film in our heads just because it is the beginning of the New Year, but we are serious about making changes. We just make some half hard resolution and it evaporates after a week or two. The experience makes us less successful and leads us to discount ability to change in the future. It’s not the changes impossible, but it won’t last unless our resolutions are supported with plans for implementation. We have to make our intensions manageable by detailing the specific steps that will carry us to our goal.
Say your goal is to lose weight by dieting and cutting off sweets. But one night you just have to have a cookie and you know there is a bag of your favorites in the cupboard. You want one, you eat two, you check the bag and find out that you’ve just shot 132 calories. You say to yourself, “What the hell. I’ll polish off the whole bag.” Then you begin to draw all kinds of unpleasant conclusions about yourself. To protect your sense of yourself, you begin to discount the goal. You may think, “Well, dieting wasn’t that important to me and I wouldn’t make it anyhow.” So you’ll abandon the goal and return to your bad habits.
Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage you’ve just heard.
26. What do people usually wish to do at the beginning of the New Year?
27. How can people turn their New Year’s resolutions into reality?
28. Why does the speaker mention the example of sweets and cookies?
Passage Two
25 years ago, Ray Anderson, a single parent with a one-year-old son, witnessed a terrible accident, which took place when the driver of a truck ran a red light and collided it with the car of Sandra Drinkens. The impact of the collision killed Sandra instantly, but her three-month-old daughter was left trapped in the burning car. While others looked on in horror, Anderson jumped out of his vehicle and crawled into the car through the shattered rear window to try to free the infant. Seconds later, the car was enclosed in flames, but to everyone’s amazement, Anderson was able to pull the baby to safety. While the baby was all right, Anderson was seriously injured. Two days later, he died. But his heroic act was published widely in the media. His son was soon adopted by relatives.
The most remarkable part of this story unfolded only last week. Karen and her boyfriend Michael were looking through some old boxes when they came across some old newspaper clippings. “This is me when I was a new born baby. I was rescued from a burning car but my mother died in the accident,’’ explained Karen. Although Michael knew Karen’s mother had died years earlier, he never fully understood the circumstances until he skimmed over the news paper article. To Karen’s surprise, Michael was absorbed in the details of the accident and he began to cry uncontrollably. Then he revealed that the man that pulled Karen from the flames was the father he never knew. The two embraced and shed many tears, recounting stories told to them about their parents.
Questions 29 to 31 are based on the passage you’ve just heard.
29. What happened 25 years ago?
30. What does the speaker say about Michael’s father?
31. Why did Michael cry uncontrollably when he skimmed over the newspaper article?
Passage Three
Americans suffer from an overdose of work. Regardless of who they are or what they do, Americans spend more time at work than at any time since World War II. In 1950, the US had fewer working hours than any other industrialized country. Today it exceeds any country but Japan, where industrial employees log 2,155 hours a year, compared with 1,951 in the US, and 1,603 in the former West Germany. Between 1969 and 1989 employed Americans added an average of 138 hours to their yearly work schedules. The work week has remained at about 40 hours, but people are working more weeks each year. Specifically, paid time off, holidays, vacations, sick leave shrank by 50% in the 1980’s. As co-operations have experienced stiff competition and slower growth productivity, they have pressed employees to work longer. Cost cutting lay-offs in the 1980’s reduced the professional and managerial ranks leaving fewer people to get the job done. In lower paid occupations, when wages have been reduced, workers have added hours in overtime or extra jobs to preserve their living standards. The government estimates that more than 7 million people hold a second job. For the first time, large numbers of people say they want to cut back on working hours even if it means earning less money. But most employers are unwilling to let them to do so. The government, which has stepped back from its traditional role as a regulator of work time should take steps to make shorter hours possible.
Questions 32 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
32. In which country do the employees work the longest hours?
33. How do employed Americans manage to work more hours?
34. Why do corporations press the employees to work longer hours according to the speaker?
35. What does the speaker say many Americans prefer to do?
Compound Dictation
Nursing, as a typically female profession, must deal constantly with the false impression that nurses are there to wait on the position. As nurses, we are licensed to provide nursing care only. We do not have any legal or moral obligation to any physician. We provide health teaching, assess physical as well as emotional problems, coordinate patient-related services and make all of our nursing decisions based upon what is best or suitable for the patient. If, in any circumstance, we feel that the physician’s order is inappropriate or unsafe, we have a legal responsibility to question that order or refuse to carry it out. Nursing is not a nine-to-five job with every weekend off. All nurses are aware of that before they enter the profession. The emotional and physical stress, however, that occurs due to hard working hours is a prime reason for a lot of the career for dissatisfaction. It is sometimes required that we work overtime and that we change shifts four or five times a month. That disturbs our personal lives, disrupts our sleeping and eating habits, and isolates us from everything except job-related friends and activities. The quality of nursing care is being affected dramatically by these situations. Most hospitals are now staffed by new graduates as experienced nurses finally give up trying to change the system. Consumers of medically-related services have evidently not been affected enough yet to demand changes in our medical system. But if trends continue as predicted, they will find that most critical hospital care will be provided by new, inexperienced and sometimes inadequately-trained nurses.

Seven Ways to Save the World
Forget the old idea that conserving energy is a form of self-denial―riding bicycles, dimming the lights, and taking fewer showers. These days conservation is all about efficiency: getting the same―or better―results from just a fraction of the energy. When a slump in business travel forced Ulrich Romer to cut costs at his family-owned hotel in Germany, he replaced hundreds of the hotel’s wasteful light bulbs, getting the same light for 80 percent less power. He bought a new water boiler with a digitally controlled pump, and wrapped insulation around the pipes. Spending about 100,000 on these and other improvements, he slashed his 90,000 fuel and power bill by 60,000. As a bonus, the hotel’s lower energy needs have reduced its annual carbon emissions by more than 200 metric tons. “For us, saving energy has been very, very profitable,” he says. “And most importantly, we’re not giving up a single comfort for our guests.”
Efficiency is also a great way to lower carbon emissions and help slow global warming. But the best argument for efficiency is its cost―or, more precisely, its profitability. That’s because quickly growing energy demand requires immense investment in new supply, not to mention the drain of rising energy prices.
No wonder efficiency has moved to the top of the political agenda. On Jan. 10, the European Union unveiled a plan to cut energy use across the continent by 20 percent by 2020. Last March, China imposed a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency by 2020. Even Greorge W. Bush, the Texas oilman, is expected to talk about energy conservation in his State of the Union speech this week.
The good news is that the world is full of proven, cheap ways to save energy. Here are the seven that could have the biggest impact:
Insulate
Space heating and cooling eats up 36 percent of all the world’s energy. There’s virtually no limit to how much of that can be saved, as prototype “zero-energy homes” in Switzerland and Germany have shown. There’s been a surge in new ways of keeping heat in and cold out(or vice versa). The most advanced insulation follows the law of increasing returns: if you add enough, you can scale down or even eliminate heating and air-conditioning equipment, lowering costs even before you start saving on utility bills. Studies have shown that green workplaces(ones that don’t constantly need to have the heat or air-conditioner running)have higher worker productivity and lower sick rates.
Change Bulbs
Lighting eats up 20 percent of the world’s electricity, or the equivalent of roughly 600,000 tons of coal a day. Forty percent of that powers old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs―a 19th-century technology that wastes most of the power it consumes on unwanted heat.
Compact fluorescent lamps, or CFLs, not only use 75 to 80 percent less electricity than incandescent bulbs to generate the same amount of light, but they also last 10 times longer. Phasing old bulbs out by 2030 would save the output of 650 power plants and avoid the release of 700 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year.
Comfort Zone
Water boilers, space heaters and air conditioners have been notoriously inefficient. The heat pump has altered that equation. It removes heat from the air outside or the ground below and uses it to supply heat to a building or its water supply. In the summer the system can be reversed to cool buildings as well.
Most new residential buildings in Sweden are already heated with ground-source heat pumps. Such systems consume almost no conventional fuel at all. Several countries have used subsidies to jump-start the market, including Japan, where almost 1 million heat pumps have been installed in the past two years to heat water for showers and hot tubs.
Remake Factories
From steel mills to paper factories, industry eats up about a third of the world’s energy. The opportunities to save are vast. In Ludwigshafen, German chemicals giant BASF runs an interconnected complex of more than 200 chemical factories, where heat produced by one chemical process is used to power the next. At the Ludwigshafen site alone, such recycling of heat and energy saves the company 200 million a year and almost half its CO2 emissions. Now BASF is doing the same for new plants in China. “Optimizing（优化）energy efficiency is a decisive competitive advantage,” says BASF CEO Jürgen Hambrecht.
Green Driving
A quarter of the world’s energy―including two thirds of the annual production of oil―is used for transportation. Some savings come free of charge: you can boost fuel efficiency by 6 percent simply by keeping your car’s tires properly inflated(充气). Gasoline-electric hybrid(混合型的)models like the Toyota Prius improve mileage by a further 20 percent over conventional models.
A Better Fridge
More than half of all residential power goes into running household appliances, producing a fifth of the world’s carbon emissions. And that’s true even though manufacturers have already hiked the efficiency of refrigerators and other white goods by as much as 70 percent since the 1980s. According to an lnternational Energy Agency study, if consumers chose those models that would save them the most money over the life of the appliance, they’d cut global residential power consumption(and their utility bills)by 43 percent.
Flexible Payment
Who says you have to pay for all your conservation investments? “Energy service contractors” will pay for retrofitting(翻新改造)in return for a share of the client’s annual utility-bill savings. In Beijing, Shenwu Thermal Energy Technology Co. specializes in retrofitting China’s steel furnaces. Shenwu puts up the initial investment to install a heat exchanger that preheats the air going into the furnace, slashing the client’s fuel costs. Shenwu pockets a cut of those savings, so both Shenwu and the client profit.
If saving energy is so easy and profitable, why isn’t everyone doing it? It has to do with psychology and a lack of information. Most of us tend to look at today’s price tag more than tomorrow’s potential savings. That holds double for the landlord or developer, who won’t actually see a penny of the savings his investment in better insulation or a better heating system might generate. In many people’s minds, conservation is still associated with self-denial. Many environmentalists still push that view.
Smart governments can help push the market in the right direction. The EU’s 1994 law on labeling was such a success that it extended the same idea to entire buildings last year. To boost the market value of efficiency, all new buildings are required to have an “energy pass” detailing power and heating consumption. Countries like Japan and Germany have successively tightened building codes, requiring an increase in insulation levels but leaving it up to builders to decide how to meet them.
The most powerful incentives, of course, will come from the market itself. Over the past year, sky-high fuel prices have focused minds on efficiency like never before. Ever-increasing pressure to cut costs has finally forced more companies to do some math on their energy use.
Will it be enough? With global demand and emissions rising so fast, we may not have any choice but to try. Efficient technology is here now, proven and cheap. Compared with all other options, it’s the biggest, easiest and most profitable bang for the buck.

PartⅣ Reading Comprehension（Reading in Depth）(25 minutes)
Section A 
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2. Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage. 
Men, these days, are embracing fatherhood with the round-the-clock involvement their partners have always dreamed of―handling night feedings, packing lunches and bandaging knees. But unlike women, many find they’re negotiating their new roles with little support or information. “Men in my generation (aged 25-40) have a fear of becaming dads because we have no role models, ”says Jon Smith, a writer. They often find themselves excluded from mothers’ support networks and are eyed warily（警觉地）on the playground. 
The challenge is particularly evident in the work-place. There, men are still expected to be breadwinners climbing the corporate ladder; traditionally-minded bosses are often unsympathetic to family needs. In Denmark most new fathers only take two weeks of paternity leave（父亲的陪产假）―even though they are allowed 34 days. As much as if not more so than women, fathers struggle to be taken seriously when they request flexible arrangements. 
Though Wilfried-Fritz Maring, 54, a data-bank and Internet specialist with German firm FIZ Karlsruhe, feels that the time he spends with his daughter outweighs any disadvantages, he admits, “With my decision to work from home I dismissed any opportunity for promotion. ”
Mind-sets（思维定势）are changing gradually. When Maring had a daughter, the company equipped him with a home office and allowed him to choose a job that could be performed from there. Danish telecom company TDC initiated an internal campaign last year to encourage dads to take paternity leave: 97 percent now do. “When an employee goes on paternity leave and is with his kids, he gets a new kind of training: in how to keep cool under stress,” says spokesperson Christine Elberg Holm. For a new generation of dads, kids may come before the company―but it’s a shift that benefits both. 
47. Unlike women, men often get little support or information from ______________. 
48. Besides supporting the family, men were also expected to ______________. 
49. Like women, men hope that their desire for a flexible schedule will be ______________. 
50. When Maring was on paternity leave, he was allowed by his company to work ______________. 
51. Christine Holm believes paternity leave provides a new kind of training for men in that it can help them cope with______________. 

Section B 本题共计15分，每小题1.5分。
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 

Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage. 
Like most people, I’ve long understood that I will be judged by my occupation, that my profession is a gauge people use to see how smart or talented I am. Recently, however, was disappointed to see that it also decides how I’m treated as a person. 
Last year I left a professional position as a small-town reporter and took a job waiting tables. As someone paid to serve food to people, I had customers say and do things to me I suspect they’d never say or do to their most casual acquaintances. One night a man talking on his cell phone waved me away, then beckoned (示意) me back with his finger a minute later, complaining he was ready to order and asking where I’d been. 
I had waited tables during summers in college and was treated like a peon (勤杂工) by plenty of people. But at 19 years old, I believed I deserved inferior treatment from professional adults. Besides, people responded to me differently after I told them I was in college. Customers would joke that one day I’d be sitting at their table, waiting to be served. 
Once I graduated I took a job at a community newspaper. From my first day, I heard a respectful tone from everyone who called me. I assumed this was the way the professional world worked―cordially. 
I soon found out differently. I sat several feet away from an advertising sales representative with a similar name. Our calls would often get mixed up and someone asking for Kristen would be transferred to Christie. The mistake was immediately evident. Perhaps it was because money was involved, but people used a tone with Kristen that they never used with me. 
My job title made people treat me with courtesy. So it was a shock to return to the restaurant industry. 
It’s no secret that there’s a lot to put up with when waiting tables, and fortunately, much of it can be easily forgotten when you pocket the tips. The service industry, by definition, exists to cater to others’ needs. Still, it seemed that many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant. 
I’m now applying to graduate school, which means someday I’ll return to a profession where people need to be nice to me in order to get what they want. I think I’ll take them to dinner first, and see how they treat someone whose only job is to serve them. 
52. The author was disappointed to find that ________.
A) one’s position is used as a gauge to measure one’s intelligence
B) talented people like her should fail to get a respectable job
C) one’s occupation affects the way one is treated as a person
D) professionals tend to look down upon manual workers
53. What does the author intend to say by the example in the second paragraph?
A) Some customers simply show no respect to those who serve them. 
B) People absorbed in a phone conversation tend to be absent-minded. 
C) Waitresses are often treated by customers as casual acquaintances. 
D) Some customers like to make loud complaints for no reason at all. 
54. How did the author feel when waiting tables at the age of 19?
A) She felt it unfair to be treated as a mere servant by professionals. 
B) She felt badly hurt when her customers regarded her as a peon. 
C) She was embarrassed each time her customers joked with her. 
D) She found it natural for professionals to treat her as inferior. 

55. What does the author imply by saying “. . . many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant” (Line 3, Para. 7)?
A) Those who cater to others’ needs are destined to be looked down upon. 
B) Those working in the service industry shouldn’t be treated as servants. 
C) Those serving others have to put up with rough treatment to earn a living. 
D) The majority of customers tend to look on a servant as server nowadays. 
56. The author says she’ll one day take her clients to dinner in order to ________.
A) see what kind of person they are
B) experience the feeling of being served
C) show her generosity towards people inferior to her
D) arouse their sympathy for people living a humble life 

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. 
What’s hot for 2007 among the very rich? A ＄7. 3 million diamond ring. A trip to Tanzania to hunt wild animals. Oh, and income inequality. 
Sure, some leftish billionaires like George Soros have been railing against income inequality for years. But increasingly, centrist and right-wing billionaires are starting to worry about income inequality and the fate of the middle class. 
In December, Mortimer Zuckerman wrote a column in U. S. News & World Report, which he owns. “Our nation’s core bargain with the middle class is disintegrating, ”lamented (哀叹) the 117th-richest man in America. “Most of our economic gains have gone to people at the very top of the income ladder. Average income for a household of people of working age, by contrast, has fallen five years in a row. ” He noted that “Tens of millions of Americans live in fear that a major health problem can reduce them to bankruptcy. ”
Wilbur Ross Jr. has echoed Zuckerman’s anger over the bitter struggles faced by middle-class Americans. “It’s an outrage that any American’s life expectancy should be shortened simply because the company they worked for went bankrupt and ended health-care coverage,” said the former chairman of the International Steel Group. 
What’s happening? The very rich are just as trendy as you and I, and can be so when it comes to politics and policy. Given the recent change of control in Congress, the popularity of measures like increasing the minimum wage, and efforts by California’s governor to offer universal health care, these guys don’t need their own personal weathermen to know which way the wind blows. 
It’s possible that plutocrats（有钱有势的人）are expressing solidarity with the struggling middle class as part of an effort to insulate themselves from confiscatory（没收性的）tax policies. But the prospect that income inequality will lead to higher taxes on the wealthy doesn’t keep plutocrats up at night. They can live with that. 
No, what they fear was that the political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration will be more difficult in the United States because of what has happened to the distribution of income and economic insecurity. 
In other words, if middle-class Americans continue to struggle financially as the ultrawealthy grow ever wealthier, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain political support for the free flow of goods, services, and capital across borders. And when the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods, it’s likely to encourage reciprocal action abroad. For people who buy and sell companies, or who 
allocate capital to markets all around the world, that’s the real nightmare. 
57. What is the current topic of common interest among the very rich in America?
A) The fate of the ultrawealthy people. 
B) The disintegration of the middle class. 
C) The inequality in the distribution of wealth. 
D) The conflict between the left and the right wing. 
58. What do we learn from Mortimer Zuckerman’s lamentation?
A) Many middle-income families have failed to make a bargain for better welfare. 
B) The American economic system has caused many companies to go bankrupt. 
C) The American nation is becoming more and more divided despite its wealth. 
D) The majority of Americans benefit little from the natiion’s growing wealth. 
59. From the fifth paragraph we can learn that ________.
A) the very rich are fashion-conscious
B) the very rich are politically sensitive
C) universal health care is to be implemented throughout America
D) Congress has gained popularity by increasing the minimum wage
60. What is the real reason for plutocrats to express solidarity with the middle class?
A) They want to protect themselves from confiscatory taxation. 
B) They know that the middle class contributes most to society. 
C) They want to gain support for global economic integration. 
D) They feel increasingly threatened by economic insecurity. 
61. What may happen if the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods?
A) The prices of imported goods will inevitably soar beyond control. 
B) The investors will have to make great efforts to re-allocate capital. 
C) The wealthy will attempt to buy foreign companies across borders. 
D) Foreign countries will place the same economic barriers in return.

Section B 
Passage One 
Questions 26 to 29 are based on the passage you have just heard. 
In January 1989, (26) the Community of European Railways presented their proposal for a high speed pan-European train network extending from Sweden to Sicily, and from Portugal to Poland by the year 2020. (27) If their proposal becomes a reality, it will revolutionize train travel in Europe. Journeys between major cities will take half the time they take today. Brussels will be only one and a half hours from Paris. The quickest way to get from Paris to Frankfurt, from Barcelona to Madrid will be by train, not plane. When the network is complete, it will integrate three types of railway line:totally new high speed lines with trains operating at speeds of 300 kilometers per hour, upgraded lines which allow for speeds up to 200 to 225 kilometers per hour, and existing lines for local connections and distribution of freight. If business people can choose between a three-hour train journey from city-center to city-center and a one-hour flight, they’ll choose the train, says an executive travel consultant. They won’t go by plane any more. (28) If you calculate flight time, check-in and travel to and from the airport, you’ll find almost no difference. And if your plane arrives late due to bad weather or air traffic jams or strikes, then the train passengers will arrive at their destination first. (29) Since France introduced the first 260-kilometer-per-hour high speed train service between Paris and Lyons in 1981, the trains have achieved higher and higher speeds. On many routes, airlines have lost up to 90% of their passengers to high speed trains. If people accept the Community of European Railways’ plan, the 21 century will be the new age of the train. 
预览四道题的选项，由选项中的词汇passengers, railroad, railway lines, express train, plane, airlines等表达可以推
知，短文很可能与交通运输或旅行相关。
26. What is the proposal presented by the Community of European Railways?
［答案］D) To set up an express train network throughout Europe.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是表示目的的不定式短语，因此猜测本题考查做某事的目的。
[精解]短文开头提到1989年欧洲铁道协会提出建议在2020年前修建从瑞典到西西里，从葡萄牙到波兰的横贯欧洲的高速铁路网。由此可知欧洲铁道协会提出的建议是修建横贯欧洲的高速铁路网，故选项D)正确。
27. What will happen when the proposal becomes a reality?
［答案］C) Traveling time by train between major European cities will be cut by half.
[听前猜测]四个选项关于旅行费用和旅行时间的变化、旅行方式的优劣，这些都与某一事件的后果有关，因此推测本题考查某一事件带来的影响。
[精解]短文中明确提到If their proposal becomes a reality, it will revolutionize train travel in Europe. Journeys 
between major cities will take half the time they take today，即“如果这一方案成为现实，欧洲铁路运输业将会发生革命性变化。主要城市间的旅行时间可以比现在缩短一半”，所以本题的答案为C)。
28. Why will business people prefer a three-hour train journey to a one-hour flight?
［答案］D) Traveling by train may be as quick as,or even quicker than, by air.

[精解]文中提到，飞机旅行固然比火车旅行更快，但是如果把飞行时间和往返机场的时间加起来，两者几乎没有
什么区别了。而且，如果遇到恶劣天气或航班拥挤或罢工，乘坐火车的乘客将会最先到达目的地。综合而言，火车旅行可以和飞机旅行一样快，甚至比飞机旅行还要快。故选项D)正确。
29. When did France introduce the first high speed train service?
［答案］A) In 1981.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是时间短语，因此本题肯定考查事情发生的时间，听音时注意将短文中提到每个事件及其发生的时间迅速记录下来，再根据问题进行判断。

Passage Two
Questions 30 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.
(30) Western doctors are beginning to understand what traditional healers have always known that the body and the mind are inseparable. Until recently, modern urban physicians heal the body, psychiatrist the mind, and priests the soul. However, the medical world is now paying more attention to holistic medicine, which is an approach based on the belief that people’s state of mind can make them sick or speed their recovery from sickness. (31) Several study show that the effectiveness of a certain drug often depends on the patient’s expectations of it. For example, in one recent study, psychiatrist and a major hospital tried to see how patients could be made calm. They divided them into two groups. One group was given a drug while the other group received a harmless substance instead of medicine without their knowledge. Surprisingly, more patients in the second group showed the desired effect than those in the first group. In study after study, there’s a positive reaction in almost one-third of the patients taking harmless substances. How was this possible? How can such a substance have an effect on the body? (32) Evidence from a 1997 study at the University of California shows that several patients who received such substances were able to produce their own natural drug, that is, as they took the substance their brains released natural chemicals that act like a drug. Scientists theorized that the amount of these chemicals released by a person’s brain quite possibly indicates how much faith the person has in his or her doctor. 
预览三道题各选项，出现了很多与医生和病人相关的词汇，如mental patients，healing，medical profession，doctor，hospital，recovery，drug，remedies等，由此可以推测这篇短文的谈论话题为医疗医药。
30. According to the speaker, what are western doctors beginning to understand?
［答案］C) The mind and body should be taken as an integral whole.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是陈述句，都是人们对事情的看法，因此推断本题考查人们对事情的看法。
[精解]文章一开始提到西方的医生们开始理解传统医者的关于“人的身体和意识是不能分离”的观点，故本题应该选择C)。
31. What does the recent study at a major hospital seem to prove?
［答案］D) A patient’s expectations of a drug have an effect on their recovery.
[听前猜测]四个选项中除了B)都提到了影响病人康复的因素，有doctor’s fame，harmless substances和patient’s expectations of a drug等，由此推测本题考查影响病人康复快慢的各种因素。
[精解]文章中间部分提到多项研究表明，the effectiveness of a certain drug often depends on the patient’s expectations of it，即“药效往往取决于病人对药物的期待程度”，选项D)是对此意的转述，故为正确答案。
32. What evidence does the 1997 study at the University of California produce?
［答案］B) The workings of the mind may help patients recover.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是与病人的治疗效果有关，听音时注意相关介绍。
[精解]文章在最后部分介绍了加州大学1997年的研究。研究表明，许多服用无毒物质的病人能够在体内释放出象药物一样的化学物质。换句话说，病人的意识对康复有很大的影响。
Passage Three
Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
33. 
(35) So we’ve already talked a bit about the growth of extreme sports like rock-climbing. As psychologists, we need to ask ourselves: Why is this person doing this? Why do people take these risks and put themselves in danger when they don’t have to? (33) One common trait among risk-takers is that they enjoy strong feelings or sensations. We call this trait sensation-seeking. A sensation-seeker is someone who’s always looking for new sensations. What else do we know about sensation-seekers? Well, as I said, sensation-seekers like strong emotions. You can see this trait in many parts of a person’s life, not just in extreme sports. For example, many sensation-seekers enjoy hard rock music. They like the loud sound and strong emotion of the songs. Similarly, sensation-seekers enjoy frightening horror movies. They like the feeling of being scared and horrified while watching the movie. This feeling is even stronger for extreme sports where the person faces real danger. Sensation-seekers feel the danger is very exciting. In addition, sensation-seekers like new experiences that force them to push their personal limits. (34) For them, repeating the same things everyday is boring. Many sensation-seekers choose jobs that involve risk, such as starting a new business or being an emergency room doctor. These jobs are different everyday, so they never know what will happen. That’s why many sensation-seekers also like extreme sports. When you do rock-climbing, you never know what will happen. The activity is always new and different. 
预览三道题各选项，根据33、34题推断本文可能与一些高难度的刺激活动相关，如攀岩、看恐怖电影等。
33. According to the speaker, what is a common trait among risk-takers?
［答案］A) Enjoying strong feelings and emotions.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是动名词短语，而且都是描述人的喜好的，可以推测本题考查人的喜好或性格特点。
[精解]文章中提到，喜欢冒险的人的一个最常见的特性是they enjoy strong feelings or sensations，即他们喜欢强烈的感觉和感情。sensation意为“感觉，感情”，与emotion同义，故选项A)正确。
34. What do sensation-seekers find boring?
［答案］D) Doing daily routines.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是动名词短语，都是一些人类活动，由此推测本题可能考查人的动作。
[精解]文章在后半部分提到For them, repeating the same things everyday is boring，即对他们(喜欢冒险的人)来说，每天重复同样的事情是很无聊的，选项D)中的daily routine和repeating the same things everyday属于同义转述，故选项D)正确。
35. What is the speaker’s profession?
［答案］B) A psychologist.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是表示人的职业的名词，因此推断本题考查人的职业。
[精解]文章主要谈论喜欢冒险的人喜欢做的事情及其原因，再加上文章一开始就提到
So we’ve already talked a bit about the growth of extreme sports like rock-climbing. As psychologists, we need to ask ourselves. . . 从说话的口气和自称psychologist可知，说话人的职业是psychologist，故选项B)正确。

Part Ⅳ Reading Comprehension（Reading in Depth）(25 minutes)
Section A
议论文。本文讨论了男性劳动者在身为人父后所面临的来自家庭和职场的双重压力。随着思维定势的转变，人们采取了一些灵活的方法来解决该问题，照顾子女和拼搏职场不再是完全对立的，而是变得相得益彰。
47. mother’s support networks
[定位]根据题干中的unlike women和support or information定位到原文第一段第2句But unlike women, many find they’re negotiating their new roles with little support or information和第4句They often find themselves excluded from mother’s support networks. . . 
[精解]本题问的是男女双方在获得支持和信息方面的不同。题干中的get little. . . 和第4句中的excluded是同义转述，两个句子都含有from引导的介词短语，from的宾语mother’s support networks就是本题的答案。
48. climb the corporate ladder
[定位]根据题干中的men were also expected to定位到原文第二段第2句There, men are still expected to be breadwinners climbing the corporate ladder. 
[精解]本题针对男士应该承担的责任提问，题干中已经给出了其责任之一：supporting family，这和第2句中的be breadwinners“负担家计的人”属同义转述。分析第2句的句子结构，现在分词climbing引导的短语作伴随状语，其内容就是男人应该承担的另一个责任，即climbing the corporate ladder。但是结合题干对原文作出的改变，be expected to后要接动词原形，故本题答案为climb the corporate ladder。
49. taken seriously
[定位]根据题干中的flexible schedule定位到原文第2段末句As much as if not more so than women, fathers struggle to be taken seriously when they request flexible arrangements. 
[精解]题干中的like是对原句中As much as if not more so than的概括与同义转述，desire和request，hope和struggle也为同义转述，同时两个句子结构相同，都使用了被动语态，所以答案就很清楚了，为taken seriously。
50. at home/in a home office
[定位]根据题干中的Maring, paternity leave和his company定位到原文第4段第2句When Maring had a daughter, the company equipped him with a home office and allowed him to chose a job that could be performed from there. 
[精解]本题针对Maring休陪产假时的工作地点提问。题干中Maring was on paternity leave(休陪产假)和原句中的Maring had a daughter(有了女儿)是同义转述，原句中提到公司为他配备了一间家庭办公室，显然是允许他在家中工作，所以本题的答案为at home或in a home office。
51. stress
[定位]根据题干中的人名Christine Holm, paternity leave和a new kind of training定位到原文末段第4句“When an employee goes on paternity leave and is with his kids, he gets a new kind of training:in how to keep cool under stress, ”says spokesperson Christine Elberg Holm. 
[精解]题目问为什么陪产假能够让男性员工得到锻炼。根据原句可知，陪产假可以让员工接受一种新的训练：如何在压力下保持冷静。结合题干，可见，陪产假可以帮助员工应对stress(压力)，这就是本题的答案。


Section B
Passage One
52. C)。 [定位]由题干中的the author was disappointed定位到原文首段第2句Recently, however, I was disappointed to see that it also decides how I’m treated as a person. 
[精解]语义题。首先要确定从句中的主语it指代前一句中的my occupation(职业)，由此可以看出，让作者感到失望的是“我的工作也能决定我身而为人是如何被对待的”，选项C)“人的工作可以影响到他作为一个人被对待的方式”与原文是同义转述，因此C)为答案。
53. A)。 [定位]由题干中提到的the example in the second paragraph定位到第2段。
[精解]推断题。第2段所举事例是说，作者在当饭店招待员时碰到了一位蛮横无礼的顾客，对她随意地呼来唤去。由此可见，作者想表达的意思是：很多顾客不尊重为他们提供服务的人，所以A)正确。
54. D)。 [定位]由题干中的waiting tables at the age of 19定位到原文第3段第2句But at 19 years old, I believed I deserved inferior treatment from professional adults. 
[精解]语义题。作者19岁时在饭店当招待员，不被顾客尊重，她对此的看法是“deserved inferior treatment”，即“比别人低人一等是理所应当的”，换句话说，作者认为这是十分自然的，即选项D)所述的“natural”。正确答案为D)。
55. B)。 [定位]由题干定位到原文第7段末句Still, it seemed that many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant. 
[精解]推断题。本题问的是作者说这句话所要表达的深意。句子的意思是“很多顾客没有弄清楚server(侍者)和servant(仆人)的区别”，换句话说，许多顾客把给他们提供服务的服务生当成仆人了，在现代社会中，这显然是不正确的，即选项B)所述“服务行业的人员不应该被当成仆人来对待。”
56. A)。 [定位]由题干中的She’ll one day take her clients to dinner定位到原文末段最后一句I’ll take them to dinner first, and see how they treat someone whose only job is to serve them. 
[精解]推断题。原文中提到，对于有求于她的人，作者会先带他去吃饭，看看他是如何对待那些唯一的工作就是为他们提供服务的人。结合前文作者的经历和感受，可以看出，作者是想通过观察他对服务生的态度和举止来了解这个人的品性，故选项A)为答案。

参考译文：
同大部分人一样，我早就明白人们会通过我从事的工作来判断我。我的职业就如同一个标尺，人们通过它来衡量我有多么聪明或睿智。(52)但是，最近令我深感失望的是，我看到工作同样也决定了身而为人的我将会如何被对待。
去年，我辞职不再做小镇的记者，转而找了一份招待员的工作。做着领薪水为他人提供餐饮服务的工作，我遇到一些顾客，他们对我说了一些也做了一些我觉得他们从来没有对一般的熟人说过或做过的事情。(53)一天晚上一个拿着手机打电话的男子挥手示意我离开，然后不到一分钟又用手指示意我回来，埋怨说他已经准备好点菜，问我去哪里了。
暑假里我在大学里当招待员，被很多人当作勤杂工一样对待。(54)但是年仅19岁的年龄，我认为接受一些来自成年职业人士的劣等对待并无不当。况且，在我告诉他们我在上大学时，他们对我的反应就会有所不同。客人们会对我开玩笑说，有朝一日我也可以坐在桌子边上，等候着有人提供服务。
毕业之后，我在一家社区报纸找到了一份工作。从第一天起，我从任何一位称呼我的人口中听到的都是尊敬的口吻。我以为这就是职场的运作方式――诚恳。
很快我有了不同的发现。我坐的位置距离一位和我的名字非常相似的广告销售代表仅有几英尺远。我们的电话经常混淆，Kristen的电话会被转接给Christie。错误很快就清楚了。也许是因为钱的缘故，对着Kristen讲话时，人们总是使用一种从来没有对我使用过的口吻。
我的工作头衔让人们非常谦恭地对待我。所以，重新回到饭店行业让人感到震惊。
站在桌边等顾客点菜时有很多需要容忍的事情，这已经不是什么秘密了。但是，幸运的是，当你拿到小费时，就会忘记很多的不满。服务业，顾名思义，它之所以存在就是要满足别人的需要。(55)而且，看起来我的很多顾客没有弄清楚server(侍者)和servant(仆人)的区别。
现在我正在申请读研究生，这就意味着将来有一天我会重新找到一份工作，一份人们为了得到他们想得到的东西而对我非常友好的工作。(56)我想我会先带他们去吃饭，借机看一下他们是如何对待那些唯一的工作就是为他们提供服务的人。

Passage Two
57. C)。 [定位]由题干中的current topic of common interest among the very rich定位到原文首段。
[精解]细节题。题干中的current topic of common interest是对原文中hot一词的具体解释。对于富人们2007年最感兴趣的事情，原文中提到了三个：A $7. 3 million diamond ring，A trip to Tanzania to hunt wild animals和income inequality，其中第3个是最重要的，结合选项可以看出本题的答案是C)。
58. C)。 [定位]由题干中的Mortimer Zucherman’s lamentation定位到原文第三段中的一系列进行哀叹的话语。
[精解]语义题。第三段第3句提到“我们的大部分经济收入都进入了位于收入台阶最顶层的富翁的腰包中。形成鲜明对比的是，对于一家人都是工薪阶层的人来说，五年来的平均收入呈连续下降趋势。”选项C)“虽然财富在不断增加，但是美国人的贫富分化状况不断加大”对此进行了概括，是本题的答案。
59. B)。 [定位]由题干中的the fifth paragraph定位到原文第5段的内容。
[精解]推断题。第5段第2句提到“巨富者和你我一样都能跟得上潮流，在涉及政治和政策问题时，也是如此”，由此可见，巨富者不但关心时尚变化，而且十分关注政治和政策，即选项B)所说的“巨富者在政治上十分敏感”。
60. C)。 [定位]由题干中的plutocrats和express solidarity with the middle class定位到原文第6段首句It’s possible that plutocrats are expressing solidarity with the struggling middle class as part of an effort to insulate themselves from confiscatory tax policies. 
[精解]推断题。本题提问有钱有势的人向中产阶级表示团结的real reason(真正原因)。从表面上看，有钱有势的人向中产阶级表示团结，目的是防止出现没收性的税收政策，会觉得A)正确；但是继续往下读文章，第7段继续陈述了有钱有势的人害怕中产阶级的深层原因，也是真正原因：the political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration will be more difficult in the United States. . . ，简而言之，他们希望在全球经济融合问
题上获得中产阶级的支持，这才是他们的最大利益所在，即C)所述内容。因此选项C)是本题的答案。61. D)。 [定位]由题干中的条件从句if the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods定位到原文末段第2句And when the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods, it’s likely to encourage reciprocal action abroad. 
[精解]语义题。题干的条件从句和原文中的很相似，而且题干中的what may happen是对原文中的it’s likely to. . . 的同义转述，后面的内容encourage reciprocal action abroad就是答案所在。reciprocal意为“相应的，交互的”，所以本题的答案为D)“作为回应，外国也会设置同样的经济壁垒”。

参考译文：
(57)2007年巨富们对什么事情最关心？价值730万美元的钻戒。去坦桑尼亚旅行、打猎。哦，还有收入的不平等。
的确，一些象George Soros一样的左派富翁多年来一直抨击收入不公平问题。但是，中间派议员们和右派富翁也越来越担心收入不公平问题和中产阶级的命运。
12月份，Mortimer Zuckerman在自己拥有的《美国新闻与世界报导》上发表专栏文章。“我们国家与中产阶级之间的核心契约正在瓦解，”美国排名第117位的富翁哀叹道。“(58)我们的大部分经济收入都进入了位于收入台阶最顶层的富翁的腰包中。形成鲜明对比的是，对于一家人都是工薪阶层的人来说，五年来的平均收入呈连续下降趋势。”他说，“成百上千万美国人生活在恐惧中，他们害怕严重的健康问题会让他们破产。”
Zuckerman对于中产阶级所面临的苦苦挣扎表示极大愤慨，Wilbur Ross Jr. 随即作出响应。“如果任何美国人寿命的缩短仅仅是因为他所工作的公司破产而没法享受健康救助，这简直就是暴行，”国际钢铁组织前任主席说。
到底在发生着什么？(59)巨富者和你我一样都能跟得上潮流，在涉及政治和政策问题时，也是如此。就拿最近国会控制权发生的变化，增加最低工资举措的受欢迎以及加利福尼亚州州长努力推行普及健康救助的行动来说，这些人不需要个人天气预报员来了解风往哪个方向吹。
(60)有钱有势的人与苦苦挣扎的中产阶级表示团结以使他们远离没收性的税收政策。这一点是有可能的。但是收入不公平会导致对富者更多的税率的可能性并没有让有钱有势的人半夜里睡不着觉。他们能够承受得了。
不，(60)他们担心的是，因为收入分配和经济安全的现状，若要使全球经济融合得到越来越多的人的支持的政治挑战在美国会变得更困难。
换句话说，如果美国的中产阶级继续在财政问题上挣扎，而巨富者越来越富有的话，物品、服务和资本跨越国境自由流通将越来越难获得政治上的支持。(61)当美国对外国投资者和外国商品设置障碍时，很有可能国外也会采取相对应的措施。这样，对于那些买卖公司或者向全球市场分配资本的人来说，这无疑是一个真正的梦魇。

What will the world be like in fifty years?


This week some top scientists, including Nobel Prize winners, gave their vision of how the world will look in 2056,fron gas-powered cars to extraordinary health advances, John Ingham reports on what the world’s finest minds believe our futures will be.

For those of us lucky enough to live that long,2056 will be a world of almost perpetual youth, where obesity is a remote memory and robots become our companions.

We will be rubbing shoulders with aliens and colonizing outer space. Better still, our descendants might at last live in a world at peace with itself.

The prediction is that we will have found a source of inexbaustible, safe, green energy, and that science will have killed off religion. If they are right we will have removed two of the main causes of war-our dependence on oil and religious prejudice.

Will we really, as today’s scientists claim, be able to live for ever or at least cheat the ageing process so that the average person lives to 150?

Of course, all these predictions come with a scientific health warning. Harvard professor Steven Pinker says: “This is an invitation to look foolish, as with the predictions of domed cities and nuclear-powered vacuum cleaners that were made 50 year ago.”


Living longer

Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute in North Carolina, belives failing organs will be repaired by injecting cells into the body. They will naturally to straight to the injury and help heal it. A system of injections without needles could also slow the ageing process by using the same process to “tune” cells.

Bruce Lahn, professor of human genetics at the University of Chicago, anticipates the ability to produce“unlimited supplies” of transplantable human organs without the needed a new organ, such as kidney, the surgeon would contact a commercial organ producer, give him the patient’s immuno-logical profile and would then be sent a kidney with the correct tissue type.

These organs would be entirely composed of human cells, grown by introducing them into animal hosts, and alloweing them to deveoop into and organ in place of the animal’s own. But Prof. Lahn believes that farmed brains would be “off limits”.He says: “Very few people would want to have their brains replaced by someone else’s and we probably don’t want to put a human brain ing an animal body.”

Richard Miller, a professor at the University of Michigan, thinks scientist could develop“an thentic anti-ageing drugs” by working out how cells in larger animals such as whales and human resist many forms of injuries. He says:“It’s is now routine, in laboratory mammals, to extend lifespan by about 40%. Turning on the same protective systems in people should, by 2056, create the first class of 100-year-olds who are as vigorous and productive as today’s people in their 60s”

Aliens

Conlin Pillinger ,professor of planerary sciences at the Open University,says:”I fancy that at least we will be able to show that life didi start to evolve on Mars well as Earth.”Within 50years he hopes scientists will prove that alien life came here in Martian meteorites(陨石).

Chris McKay,a planetary scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center.believes that in 50 years we may find evidence of alien life in ancient permanent forst of Mars or on other planers.

He adds:”There is even a chance we will find alien life forms here on Earth.It mightbe as different as English is to Chinese.

Priceton professor Freeman Dyson thinks it “likely” that life form outer space will be discovered defore 2056 because the tools for finding it, such as optical and radio detection and data processing,are improving.

He ays:”As soon as the first evidence is found,we will know what to look for and additional discoveries are likely to follow quickly.Such discoveries are likely to have revolutionary consequences for biology, astronomy and philosophy. They may change the way we look at ourselves and our place in the universe.


Colonies in space

Richard Gottprofessor of astrophysics at Princeton,hopes man will set up a self-sufficient colony on Mars,which would be a “life insurance policy against whatever catastrophes,natural or otherwise,might occur on Earth.

“The real space race is whether we will colonise off Earth on to other worlds before money for the space programme runs out.”


Spinal injuries

Ellen Heber-Katz,a professor at the Wistar Institude in Philadelphia,foresees cures for inijuries causing paralysis such as the one that afflicated Superman star Christopher Reeve.

She says:”I believe that the day is not far off when we will be able to profescribe drugs that cause severes(断裂的) spinal cords to heal,hearts to regenerate and lost limbs to regrow.

“People will come to expect that injured or diseased organs are meant to be repaired from within,inmuch the same way that we fix an appliance or automobile:by replancing the damaged part with a manufacturer-certified new part.”She predict that within 5 to 10 years fingers and toes will be regrown and limbs will start to be regrown a few years later. Reparies to the nervous system will start with optic nerves and,in time,the spinal cord.”Within 50years whole body replacement will be routine,”Prof.Heber-Katz adds.

Obesity 

Sydney Brenner,senior distinguished fellow of the Crick-Jacobs Center in California,won the 2002 Noblel Prize for Medicine and says that if there is a global disaster some humans will survive-and evolition will favour small people with bodies large enough to support the required amount of brain power.”Obesity,”he says.”will have been solved.”


Robots

Rodney Brooks,professor of robotice at MIT,says the problems of developing artificial intelligence for robots will be at least partly overcome.As a result,”the possibilities for robots working with people will open up immensely”


Energy

Bill Joy,green technology expert in Califomia,says:”The most significant breakthrought would be to have an inexhaustible source of safe,green energy that is substantially cheaper than any existing energy source.”

Ideally,such a source would be safe in that it could not be made into weapons and would not make hazardous or toxic waste or carbon dioxide,the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. 


Society

Geoffrey Miller,evolutionary psychologist at the University of New Mexico,says:”The US will follow the UKin realizing that religion is nor a prerequisite (前提)for ordinary human decency.

“This,science will kill religion-not by reason challenging faith but by offering a more practical,uniwersal and rewarding moral frameworkfor human interaction.”

He also predicts that “ahsurdly wasteful”displays of wealth will become umfashionable while the importance of close-knit communities and families will become clearer.

These there changer,he says,will help make us all”brighe\ter,wiser,happier and kinder”.

Compound Dictation

I'm interested in the criminal justice system of our country. It seems to me that something has to be done if we are to survive as a country. I certainly don't know what the answers to our problems are. Things certainly get complicated in a hurry when you get into them. But I wonder if something couldn't be done to deal with some of these problems. 


One thing I'm concerned about is our practice of putting offenders in jail who haven't harmed anyone. Why not work out some system whereby they can pay back the debts they owe society instead of incurring another debt by going to prison, and of course, coming under the influence of hardened criminals? I'm also concerned about the short prison sentences people are serving for serious crimes. Of course, one alternative to this is to restore capital punishment, but I'm not sure I would be for that. I'm not sure it's right to take an eye for eye. 

Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)

Section A

Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write our answers on Answer Sheet 2


Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.

if movie trailers(预告片)are supposed to cause a reaction, the preview for "United 93" more than succeeds. Featuring no famous actors, it begins with images of a beautiful morning and passengers boarding an airplane. It takes you a minute to realize what the movie's even about. That’s when a plane hits the World Trade Center. the effect is visceral(震撼心灵的). When the trailer played before "Inside Man" last week at a Hollywood theater, audience members began calling out, "Too soon!" In New York City, the response was even more dramatic. The Loews theater in Manhattan took the rare step of pulling the trailer from its screens after several complaints.

"United 93" is the first feature film to deal explicitly with the events of September 11, 2001, and is certain to ignite an emotional debate. Is it too soon? Should the film have been made at all? More to the point, will anyone want to see it? Other 9/11 projects are on the way as the fifth anniversary of the attacks approaches, most notably Oliver Stone's " World Trade Center." but as the forerunner, "United 93"will take most of the heat, whether it deserves it or not.

The real United 93 crashed in a Pennsylvania field after 40 passengers and crew fought back against the terrorists. Writer-director Paul Greengrass has gone to great lengths to be respectful in his depiction of what occurred, proceeding with the film only after securing the approval of every victim's family. "Was I surprised at the agreement? Yes. Very. Usually there’re one or two families who're more reluctant," Greengrass writes in an e-mail. "I was surprised at the extraordinary way the United 93 families have welcomed us into their lives and shared their experiences with us." Carole O'Hare, a family member, says, "They were very open and honest with us, and they made us a part of this whole project." Universal, which is releasing the film, plans to donate 10% of its opening weekend gross to the Flight 93 National Memorial Fund. That hasn't stopped criticism that the studio is exploiting a national tragedy. O'Hare thinks that's unfair. "This story has to be told to honor the passengers and crew for what they did," she says. "But more than that, it raises awareness. Our ports aren't secure. Our borders aren't secure. Our airlines still aren't secure, and this is what happens when you're not secure. That’s the message I want people to hear."

51. Carole O’Hare thinks that besides honoring the passengers and crew for what they did, the purpose of telling the story is to raise the awareness about security.

Section B

Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line thought the centre.

Passage One

Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.

Imagine waking up and finding the value of your assets has been halved. No, you’re not an investor in one of those hedge funds that failed completely. With the dollar slumping to a 26-year low against the pound, already-expensive London has become quite unaffordable. A coffee at Starbucks, just as unavoidable in England as it is in the United States, runs about $8.

The once all-powerful dollar isn’t doing a Titanic against just the pound. It is sitting at a record low against the euro and at a 30-year low against the Canadian dollar. Even the Argentine peso and Brazilian real are thriving against the dollar.

The weak dollar is a source of humiliation, for a nation’s self-esteem rests in part on the strength of its currency. It’s also a potential economic problem, since a declining dollar makes imported food more expensive and exerts upward pressure on interest rates. And yet there are substantial sectors of the vast U.S. economy-from giant companies like Coca-Cola to mom-and-pop restaurant operators in Miami-for which the weak dollar is most excellent news.

Many Europeans may view the U.S. as an arrogant superpower that has become hostile to foreigners. But nothing makes people think more warmly of the U.S. than a weak dollar. Through April, the total number of visitors from abroad was up 6.8 percent from last year. Should the trend continue, the number of tourists this year will finally top the 2000 peak? Many Europeans now apparently view the U.S. the way many Americans view Mexico-as a cheap place to vacation, shop and party, all while ignoring the fact that the poorer locals can’t afford to join the merrymaking. 

The money tourists spend helps decrease our chronic trade deficit. So do exports, which thanks in part to the weak dollar, soared 11 percent between May 2006 and May 2007. For first five months of 2007, the trade deficit actually fell 7 percent from 2006.

If you own shares in large American corporations, you’re a winner in the weak-dollar gamble. Last week Coca-Cola’s stick bubbled to a five-year high after it reported a fantastic quarter. Foreign sales accounted for 65 percent of Coke’s beverage business. Other American companies profiting from this trend include McDonald’s and IBM.

American tourists, however, shouldn’t expect any relief soon. The dollar lost strength the way many marriages break up- slowly, and then all at once. And currencies don’t turn on a dime. So if you want to avoid the pain inflicted by the increasingly pathetic dollar, cancel that summer vacation to England and look to New England. There, the dollar is still treated with a little respect.

52. Why do Americans feel humiliated?

A) Their economy is plunging B) They can’t afford trips to Europe

C) Their currency has slumped D) They have lost half of their assets.

They find it unaffordable to dine in mom-and-pop restaurants.

They have to spend more money when buying imported goods.

They might lose their jobs due to potential economic problems.


54 How do many Europeans feel about the U.S with the devalued dollar?

They feel contemptuous of it

They are sympathetic with it.

They regard it as a superpower on the decline.

They think of it as a good tourist destination.


55 what is the author’s advice to Americans?

They treat the dollar with a little respect

They try to win in the weak-dollar gamble

They vacation at home rather than abroad

They treasure their marriages all the more.


56 What does the author imply by saying “currencies don’t turn on a dime” (Line 2,Para 7)?

The dollar’s value will not increase in the short term.

The value of a dollar will not be reduced to a dime

The dollar’s value will drop, but within a small margin.

Few Americans will change dollars into other currencies.

Passage Two

Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.


In the college-admissions wars, we parents are the true fights. We are pushing our kids to get good grades, take SAT preparatory courses and build resumes so they can get into the college of our first choice. I’ve twice been to the wars, and as I survey the battlefield, something different is happening. We see our kids’ college background as e prize demonstrating how well we’ve raised them. But we can’t acknowledge that our obsession(痴迷) is more about us than them. So we’ve contrived various justifications that turn out to be half-truths, prejudices or myths. It actually doesn’t matter much whether Aaron and Nicole go to Stanford.

We have a full-blown prestige panic; we worry that there won’t be enough prizes to go around. Fearful parents urge their children to apply to more schools than ever. Underlying the hysteria(歇斯底里) is the belief that scarce elite degrees must be highly valuable. Their graduates must enjoy more success because they get a better education and develop better contacts. All that is plausible――and mostly wrong. We haven’t found any convincing evidence that selectivity or prestige matters. Selective schools don’t systematically employ better instructional approaches than less selective schools. On two measures――professors’ feedback and the number of essay exams――selective schools do slightly worse.

By some studies, selective schools do enhance their graduates’ lifetime earnings. The gain is reckoned at 2-4% for every 100-poinnt increase in a school’s average SAT scores. But even this advantage is probably a statistical fluke(偶然). A well-known study examined students who got into highly selective schools and then went elsewhere. They earned just as much as graduates from higher-status schools.

Kids count more than their colleges.Getting into yale may signify intellgence,talent and

Ambition. But it’s not the only indicator and,paradoxically,its significance is declining.The reason:so many similar people go elsewhere.Getting into college is not life only competiton.Old-boy networks are breaking down.princeton economist Alan Krueger studied admissions to one top Ph.D.program.High scores on the GRE helpd explain who got in;degrees of prestigious universities didn’t.

So,parents,lighten up.the stakes have been vastly exaggerated.up to a point,we can rationalize our pushiness.America is a competitive society;our kids need to adjust to that.but too much pushiness can be destructive.the very ambition we impose on our children may get some into Harvard but may also set them up for disappointment.one study found that,other things being equal,graduates of highly selective schools experienced more job dissatisfaction.They may have been so conditioned to deing on top that anything less disappoints.

答案

　　Part 1 Writing

　　范文一

　　Recent decades have seen the rapid development of information technology, and thereby E-books have wound their way into our daily life. Because of the wide and quick popularity of E-books, there has been an increasing controversy over the question of whether E-books will replace traditional books or not.

　　Many people hold the idea that it will not take long for E-books to replace traditional books because E-books have quite a few advantages over traditional ones. First, E-books are more accessible to readers, because the readers just need to log onto the internet and read online. Second, thanks to the advanced technology, the cost of E-books is much lower, so it takes readers far less money to buy E-books. Last but not the least, reading E-books has developed into part of our daily life, which is particularly appealing to young users, who are the body part of the users of electronic products.
　　 As far as I’m concerned, it is not likely for E-books to replace traditional books for lots of reasons. For example, long time of reading E-books will do more harm to our eyes, and readers will find themselves more accessible to printed materials because computers and the internet haven’t yet been popularized to every corner of our life.

　　范文二

　　E-books, or electronic books, have the same information and need the same reading experience as the traditional books, which you actually hold in your hands. E-books have so many benefits that they will replace traditional books.

　　E-books can be created on a shoestring budget while the authors of traditional books will have to overcome a tough sales target before they even consider making a profit on the book. E-books are quicker to create because they could be written and published in as little as a week while the time span between starting a traditional book and writing it could take around a year or two. E-books are easier to target a wide market because they may be sold on the Internet to anyone with a credit card and an Internet connection in any place in the world, while with a traditional book it may be difficult to expand to new markets, since it will involve further significant costs on distribution and marketing. 

　　To conclude, E-books are a very valuable tool that could be used as a profit centre, as a publishing tool or as a marketing tool. They have many advantages over the traditional books. E-books will replace traditional books.

Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and scanning) (15 minutes)
　　 Supersize surprise 
Ask anyone why there is an obesity epidemic and they will tell you that it’s al down to eating too much and burning too few calories. That explanation appeals to common sense and has dominated efforts to get to the root of the obesity epidemic and reverse it/ yet obesity researchers are increasingly dissatisfied with it. Many now believe that something else must have changed in our environment to precipitate(促成) such dramatic rises in obesity over the past 40 years or so. Nobody is saying that the “big two” C reduced physical activity and increased availability of food C are not important contributors to the epidemic, but they cannot explain it all.
Earlier this year a review paper by 20 obesity experts set out the 7 most plausible alternative explanations for the epidemic. Here they are.
1. Not enough sleep
It is widely believed that sleep is for the brain, not the body. Could a shortage of shut-eye also be helping to make us fat?
Several large-scale studies suggest there may be a link. People who sleep less than 7 hours a night tend to have a higher body mass index than people who sleep more, according to data gathered by the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Similarly, the US Nurses’ Health Study, which tracked 68,000 women for 16 years, found that those who slept an average of 5 hours a night gained more weight during the study period than women who slept 6 hours, who in turn gained more than whose who slept 7.
It’s well known that obesity impairs sleep, so perhaps people get fat first and sleep less afterwards. But the nurses’ study suggests that it can work in the other direction too: sleep loss may precipitate weight gain.
Although getting figures is difficult, it appears that we really are sleeping less. In 1960 people in the US slept an average of 8.5 hours per night. A 2002 poll by the National Sleep Foundation suggests that the average has fallen to under 7 hours, and the decline is mirrored by the increase in obesity.
2. Climate control
We humans, like all warm-blooded animals, can keep our core body temperatures pretty much constant regardless of what’s going on in the world around us. We do this by altering our metabolic(新陈代新的) rate, shivering or sweating. Keeping warm and staying cool take energy unless we are in the “thermo-neutral zone”, which is increasingly where we choose to live and work.
There is no denying that ambient temperatures(环境温度) have changed in the past few decades. Between 1970 and 2000, the average British home warmed from a chilly 13C to 18C. In the US, the changes have been at the other end of the thermometer as the proportion of homes with air conditionings rose from 23% to 47% between 1978 and 1997. In the southern states C where obesity rates tend to be highest C the number of houses with air conditioning has shot up to 71% from 37% in 1978.
Could air conditioning in summer and heating in winter really make a difference to our weight?
Sadly，there is some evidence that it does-at least with regard to heating. Studies show that in comfortable temperatures we use less energy.
3.Less smoking
Bad news: smokers really do tend to be thinner than the rest of us,and quitting really does pack on the pounds, though no one isn sure why. It probably has something to do with the fact that nicotine is an appetite suppressant and appears to up your metabolic rate.
Katherine Flegal and colleagres at the US National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville,Maryland, have calculated that people kicking the habit have been respousible for a small but significant portion of the US epidemic of fatness.From data collected aroud 1991 by the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,they worked out that people who had quit in the previous decade were much more likely to be overweight than smokers and people who had never smoked .Among men, for example, nearly half of quitters were overweight compared with 37% of non-smokers and only 28%of smokers.
4. Genetic effects
Yours chances of becoming fat may be set,at least in part,before you were even born.children of boese mothers are much more likely to become obest themselves later in life.Offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet during pregnancy are much more likely to become fat than the offspring of identical mice fed a normal diet. Intriguingly,the effect persists for two or three generations.Grand-children of mice fed a high-fat diet grow up fat even if their own mother is fed normally-so you fate may have been sealed even before you were conceived.
5.A little older…
Some groups of people just happen to be fatter than others.surveys carried out by the US national center for health statisties found that adults aged 40 to 79 were around three times as likely to be obese as younger people.non-white females also tend to fall at the fatter end of the spectreum:Mexican-american women are 30% more likely than white women to be obsess,and black women have twice the risk.
In the US,these groups account for an increasing percentage of the population.between 1970 and 2000 the US population aged 35 to 44 grew by 43%.the proportion of Hispanic-americans also grew,from under 5% to 12.5% of the population,while the proportion of black Americans increased from 11% to 12.3%.these changes may account in part for the increased prevalence of obesity.
6.mature mums
Mothers around the world are getting older.in the UK,the mean age for aving a frist child is 27.3,compared with 23.7 in 1970 .mean age at frist birth in the US has also increased, rising from 21.4 in 1970 to 24.9 in 2000.
This would be neither here nor there if it were’t for the observation that having an older mother seems to be an independent risk factor for obesity. Results from the US national heart,lung and blood institute’s study found that the odds of a child being obese increase 14% for every five extra years of their mother’s age , though why this should be so is not entirely clear.
Michael Symonds at the university of Nottingham,UK,found that first-bron children have more fat than younger ones. As family size decreases, firstbrons account for a greather share of the population. In 1964, british women gave birth to an average of 2.95 children;by 2005 that figure had fallen to 1.79. in the US in 1976, 9.6% of woman in their 40s had only one chile;in 2004 it was 17.4%. this combination of older mothers and more single children could be contributing to the obesity epidemic.
7.Like marrying like
Just as people pair off according to looks, so they do for size. Lean people are more likely to marry lean an d fat more likely to marry fat. On its own, like marrying like cannot account for any increase in obesity. But combined with others- particularly the fact that obesity is partly genetic, and that heavier people have more children-it amplifies the increase form other causes.

　　 Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes) 
　　 Section A 
　　 Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage. 
　　 One of the major producers of athletic footwear, with 2002 sales of over $10 billion, is a company called Nike, with corporate headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. Forbes magazine identified Nike’s president, Philip Knight, as the 53rd-richest man in the world in 2004. But Nike has not always been a large multimillion-dollar organization. In fact, Knight started the company by selling shoes from the back of his car at track meets. 
　　 In the late 1950s Philip Knight was a middle-distance runner on the University of Oregon track team, coached by Bill Bowerman. One of the top track coaches in the U.S., Bowerman was also known for experimenting with the design of running shoes in an attempt to make them lighter and more shock-absorbent. After attending Oregon, Knight moved on to do graduate work at Stanford University; his MBA thesis was on marketing athletic shoes. Once he received his degree, Knight traveled to Japan to contact the Onitsuka Tiger Company, a manufacturer of athletic shoes. Knight convinced the company’s officials of the potential for its product in the U.S. In 1963 he received his first shipment of Tiger shoes, 200 pairs in total. 
　　 In 1964, Knight and Bowerman contributed $500 each to from Blue Ribbon Sports, the predecessor of Nike. In the first few years, Knight distributed shoes out of his car at local track meets. The first employees hired by Knight were former college athletes. The company did not have the money to hire “experts”, and there was no established athletic footwear industry in North America from which to recruit those knowledgeable in the field. In its early years the organization operated in an unconventional manner that characterized its innovative and entrepreneurial approach to the industry. Communication was informal; people discussed ideas and issues in the hallways, on a run, or over a beer. There was little task differentiation. There were no job descriptions, rigid reporting systems, or detailed rules and regulations. The team spirit and shared values of the athletes on Bowerman’s teams carried over and provided the basis for the collegial style of management that characterized the early years of Nikes. 
　　 47. While serving as a track coach, Bowerman tried to design running shoes that were lighter and more shock-absorbent. 
　　 48. During his visit to Japan, Knight convinced the officials of the Onitsuka Tiger Company that its product would have potentials in the U.S. 
　　 49. Blue Ribbon Sports as unable to hire experts due to the absence of established athletic footwear in North America. 
　　 50. In the early years of Nike, communication within the company was usually carried out informally. 
　　 51. What qualities of Bowerman’s teams formed the basis of Nike’s early management style? 
　　 The team spirit and shared valves of the athlets. 
　　 Passage one 
　　 questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage 
　　 sustainable development is applied to just about eberything from energy to clean water and economic growth,and as a result it has become difficult to question either the basic assumptions behind it or the way the concept is put to use.this is especially true in agriculture,where sustainable development is often taken as the sole measure of progress without a proper appreciation of histrorcal and cultural perspectives. 
　　 To start with,it is important to remember that the nature of agriculture has changed markedly throughout history,and will continue to do so .medieval agriculture in northern Europe fed,clothed and shelered a predominantly rural society with a much lower population density than it is today.it had minimal effect on biodiversity,and any pollution it caused was typically localized.in termsof energy use and the nutrients captured in the product it was relatively inefficient. 
　　 Contrast this with farming since the start of the industrial revolution.competion from overseas led farmers to specialize and increase yields.throughout this period food became cheaper,safe and more reliable.however,these changes have alsoled to habitat loss and to diminishing biodiversity. 
　　 What’smore,demand for animal products in developing countrics is growing so fast that meeting it will require an extra 300 million tons of grain a year by 2050.yet the growth of cities and in dustry is reducing the amount of water available for agriculture in many regions. 
　　 All this means that agriculture in the 21st century will have to be very different from how it was in the 20th.this will require radical thinking.for example,we need to move away from the idea that traditional practices are inevitably more sustainable than new ones.we also need to abandon the notion that agriculture can be “zero impact”. The key will be to abandon the rather simple and static measures of sustainability,which centre on the need to maintain production without increasing damage.instead we need a more dynamic interpretation,one that looks at the pros and cons of all the various way land is used.there are many different ways to measure agricultural performance besides food yield:energy use, environmental costs,water purity,carbon footprint and biodiversity. It is clear, for example,that the carbon of transporting tomatoes from spain to the UK 
　　 Is less than that of producing them in the UK with additional heating and lighting.but we do not know whether lower carbon footprints will always be better for biodiversity. 
　　 What is crucial is recognizing that sustainable agriculture is not just about sustainable food production. 
　　 52. How do people ofen measure progress in agriculture? 
　　 A) By its productivity C) By its impact on the environmet 
　　 B) By its sustainability D) By its contribution to economic growth 
　　 53. Specialisation and the effort to incease yields have esulted in________. 
　　 A) Localised pollution C) competition from overseas 
　　 B) the shrinking of farmland D) the decrease of biodiversity 
　　 54.What does the author think of traditional farming practices? 
　　 A)They have remained the same over the centuries 
　　 B)They have not kept pace with population growth 
　　 C)They are not necessarily sustainable 
　　 D)They are environmentally friendly 
　　 55.What will agriculture be like in the 21st century 
　　 A) It will go through radical changes 
　　 B) It will supply more animal products 
　　 C) It will abandon traditional farming practices 
　　 D) It will cause zero damage to the environment 
　　 56 What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage? 
　　 A) To remind people of the need of sustainable development 
　　 B) To suggest ways of ensuring sustainable food production 
　　 C) To adance new criteria for measuring farming progress 
　　 D) To urge people to rethink what sustainable agriculture is 
　　 Passage Two 
　　 Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage 
　　 The percentage of immigrants(including those unlawfully present) in the United states has been creeping upward for years. At 12.6 percent, it is now higher than at any point ince the mid1920s 
　　 We are not about to go back to the days when Congress openly worried about inferior races polluing America’s bloodstream. But once again we are wondering whether we have too many of the wrong sort fo necomers.Their loudest citecs argue that the new wave of immigrants cannot,and indeed do not want to, fit in as previous generations did. 
　　 We now know that these racist views were wrong.In time, Italians, Romanians and members of other so-called inferior races became exemplary Americans and contributed greatly, in ways too numerous to detail , to the building of this magnificent nation. There is no reason why these new immigrants should not have the same success. 
　　 Although children of Mexican immigrants do better, in terms of educational and professional attainment, than thir parents UCLA sociologist Edward Telles has found that the gains don’t continme. Indeed, the fouth generation is marginally worse off than the third James Jackson,of the University of Michigan,has foud a simila rend among black Caribbean immigrants,Tells fears that Mexican-Americans may be fated to follow in the footsteps of American blacks-that largeparts of the community may become mired in a seemingly state of poverty and Underachievement . Like African-Americans, Mexican-americans are increasingly relegated to (降入)segregated, substandyrd schools, and their dropout rate is the highest for any 儿童会nic group in the country. 
　　 We have learned much about the foolish idea of excluding people on the presumption of the ethnic/racial inferiority. But what we have not yet learned is how to make the process of Americanization work for all. I am not talking about requiring people to learn English or to adopt American ways; those things happen pretty much on their own, but as arguments about immigration hear up the campaign trail, we also ought to ask some broader question about assimilation, about ho wto ensure that people , once outsiders , don’t fovever remain marginalized within these shores. 
　　 That is a much larger question than what should happen with undocumented workers, or how best to secure the border, and it is one that affects not only newcomers but groups that have been here for generations. It will have more impact on our future than where we decide to set the admissions bar for the lasest ware of would-be Americans. And it would be nice if we finally got the answer right.

　　How to improve student's mental health

　　In recent years, there have been many reports about misbehaved students resort to violence. Such behavior has exerted negative impacts towards other students, families as well as the society in a whole. Therefore how to improve students' mental health has always been a priority issue of our universities and society. To develop a student in a all-round way is the purpose of our quality-oriented education.

　　Firstly, parents as the first teacher in students' life should play an important role. The parenting method as well as the whole family environment has a direct influence towards the students. Parents should not turn to "punishment" as a tool to teach their children. Instead, they should talk to them, find out the reasons behind a certain behavior and guide them through the difficulties. Parents should always be a good listener.

　　Secondly, teachers should be trained to help students in a comprehensive way. Teachers should not just emphasize on a student's academic performance. Some students feel like they are being ignored by their teachers just because they are not performing well in the exams. Therefore as a responsible teacher, learning to treat each student fairly is of great importance.

　　Finally, it is our shared vision to build a secure and harmonious social environment for the next generation, the future of our nation.

Helicopter Moms vs. Free-Range Kids

Would you let your fourth-grader ride public transportation without an adult? Probably not. Still, when Lenore Skenazy, a columnist for the New York Sun, wrote about letting her son take the subway alone to get back to her Manhattan home from a department store on the Upper East Side, she didn’t expect to get hit with a wave of criticism from readers.
“Long story short: My son got home, overjoyed with independence,” Skenazy wrote on April 4 in the New York Sun. “Long story longer: Half the people I’ve told this episode to now want to turn on in for child abuse. As if keeping kids under lock and key and cell phone and careful watch is the right way to rear kids. It’s not. It’s debilitating (使虚弱)―for us and for them.”
Online message boards were soon full of people both applauding and condemning Skenazy’s decision to let her son go it alone. She wound up defending herself on CNN (accompanied by her son) and on popular blogs like the Buffington Post, where her follow-up piece was ironically headlined “More From America’s Worst Mom.”
The episode has ignited another one of those debates that divides parents into vocal opposing camps. Are Modern parents needlessly overprotective, or is the world a more complicated and dangerous place than it was when previous generations were allowed to wander about unsupervised?
From the “she’s an irresponsible mother” camp came: “Shame on you for being so careless about his safety,” in Comments on the Buffington Post. And there was this from a mother of four: “How would you have felt if he didn’t come home?” But Skenazy got a lot of support, too, with women and men writing in with stories about how they were allowed to take trips all by them selves at seven or eight. She also got heaps of praise for bucking the “helicopter parent” trend: “Good for this Mom,” one commenter wrote on the Buffington Post. “This is a much-needed reality check.”
Last week, encouraged by all the attention, Skenazy started her own blog―Free Range, kids―promoting the idea that modern children need some of the same independence that her generation had. In the good old days nine-year-old baby boomers rode their bikes to school, walked to the store, took buses―and even subways―all by themselves. Her blog, she says, is dedicated to sensible parenting. “At Free Range Kids, we believe in safe kids. We believe in car seats and safety belts. We do NOT believe that every time school-age children go outside, they need a security guard.”
So why are some parents so nervous about letting their children out of their sight? Are cities and towns less safe and kids more vulnerable to crimes like child kidnap and sexual abuse than they were in previous generations?

Not exactly. New York City, for instance, is safer than it’s ever been; it’s ranked 36th in crime among all American cities. Nationwide, stringer kidnaps are extremely rare; there’s a one-in-a-million chance a child will be taken by a stranger, according to the Justice Department. And 90 percent of sexual abuse cases are committed by someone the child knows. Mortality rates from all causes, including disease and accidents, for American children are lower now than they were 25 years’ ago. According to Child Trends, a nonprofit research group, between 1980 and 2003 death rates dropped by 44 percent for children aged 5 to 14 and 32 percent for teens aged 15 to 19.
Then there’s the whole question of whether modern parents are more watchful and nervous about safety than previous generations. Yes, some are. Part of the problem is that with wall to wall Internet and cable news, every missing child case gets so much airtime that it’s not surprising even normal parental anxiety can be amplified. And many middle-class parents have gotten used to managing their children’s time and shuttling them to various enriching activities, so the idea of letting them out on their own can seem like a risk. Back in 1972, when many of today’s parents were kids, 87 percent of children who lived within a mile of school walked or biked every day. But today, the Centers for Disease Control report that only 13 percent of children bike, walk or otherwise t themselves to school.
The extra supervision is both a city and a suburb phenomenon. Parents are worried about crime, and they are worried about kids getting caught in traffic in a city that’s not used to pedestrians. On the other hand, there are still plenty of kids whose parents give them a lot of independence, by choice or by necessity. The After School Alliance finds that more than 14 million kids aged 5 to 17 are responsible for taking care of themselves after school. Only 6.5 million kids participate in organized programs. “Many children who have working parents have to take the subway or bus to get to school. Many do this by themselves because they have no other way to get to the schools,” says Dr. Richard Gallagher, director of the Parenting Institute at the New York University Child Study Center.
For those parents who wonder how and when they should start allowing their kids more freedom, there’s no clear-cut answer. Child experts discourage a one-size-fits-all approach to parenting. What’s right for Skenazy’s nine-year-old could be inappropriate for another one. It all depends on developmental issue, maturity, and the psychological and emotional makeup of that child. Several factors must be taken into account, says Gallagher. “The ability to follow parent guidelines, the child’s level of comfort in handling such situations, and a child’s general judgment should be weighed.”
Gallagher agrees with Skenazy that many nine-year-olds are ready for independence like taking public transportation alone. “At certain times of the day, on certain routes, the subways are generally safe for these children, especially if they have grown up in the city and have been taught how to be safe, how to obtain help if they are concerned for their safety, and how to avoid unsafe situations by being watchful and on their toes.”
But even with more traffic and fewer sidewalks, modern parents do have one advantage their parents didn’t: the cell phone. Being able to check in with a child anytime goes a long way toward relieving parental anxiety and may help parents loosen their control a little sooner. Skenazy got a lot of criticism because she didn’t give her kid her cell phone because she thought he’d lose it and wanted him to learn to go it alone without depending on mom―a major principle of free-range parenting. But most parents are more than happy to use cell phones to keep track of their kids.
And for those who like the idea of free-range kids but still struggle with their inner helicopter parent, there may be a middle way. A new generation of GPS cell phones with tracking software make it easier than ever to follow a child’s every movement via the Internet―without seeming to interfere or hover. Of course, when they go to college, they might start objecting to being monitored as they’re on parole (假释).

Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)
Section A 
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
There is nothing new about TV and fashion magazines giving girls unhealthy ideas about how thin they need to be in order to be considered beautiful. What is surprising is the method psycholo gists at the University of Texas have come up with to keep girls from developing eating disorders. Their main weapon against superskinny (role) models: a brand of civil disobedience dubbed “body activism.”
Since 2001, more than 1,000 high school and college students in the U.S. have participated in the Body Project, which works by getting girls to understand how they have been buying into the notion that you have to be thin to be happy or successful. After critiquing (评论) the so-called thin ideal by writing essays and role-playing with their peers, participants are directed to come up with and execute small, nonviolent acts. They include slipping notes saying “Love your body the way it is” into dieting books at stores like Borders and writing letters to Mattel, makers of the impossibly proportioned Barbie doll.
According to a study in the latest issue of the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, the risk of developing eating disorders was reduced 61% among Body Project participants. And they continued to exhibit positive body-image attitudes as long as three years after completing the program, which consists, of four one-hour sessions. Such lasting effects may be due to girls’ realizing not only how they were being influenced but also who was benefiting from the societal pressure to be thin. “These people who promote the perfect body really don’t care about you at all,” says Kelsey Hertel, a high school junior and Body Project veteran in Eugene, Oregon. “They purposefully make you feel like less of a person so you’ll buy their stuff and they’ll make money.”

Section B 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C), and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage OneQuestions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
For hundreds of millions of years, turtles (海龟) have struggled out of the sea to lay their eggs on sandy beaches, long before there were nature documentaries to celebrate them, or GPS satellites and marine biologists to track them, or volunteers to hand-carry the hatchlings (幼龟) down to the water’s edge lest they become disoriented by headlights and crawl towards a motel parking lot instead. A formidable wall of bureaucracy has been erected to protect their prime nesting on the Atlantic coastlines. With all that attention paid to them, you’d think these creatures would at least have the gratitude not to go extinct.
But Nature is indifferent to human notions of fairness, and a report by the Fish and Wildlife Service showed a worrisome drop in the populations of several species of North Atlantic turtles, notably loggerheads, which can grow to as much as 400 pounds. The South Florida nesting population, the largest, has declined by 50% in the last decade, according to Elizabeth Griffin, a marine biologist with the environmental group Oceana. The figures prompted Oceana to petition the government to upgrade the level of protection for the North Atlantic loggerheads from “threatened” to “endangered”―meaning they are in danger of disappearing without additional help.
Which raises the obvious question: what else do these turtles want from us, anyway? It turns out, according to Griffin, that while we have done a good job of protecting the turtles for the weeks they spend on land (as egg-laying females, as eggs and as hatchlings), we have neglected the years spend in the ocean. “The threat is from commercial fishing,” says Griffin. Trawlers (which drag large nets through the water and along the ocean floor) and longline fishers (which can deploy thousands of hooks on lines that can stretch for miles) take a heavy toll on turtles.
Of course, like every other environmental issue today, this is playing out against the background of global warming and human interference with natural ecosystems. The narrow strips of beach on which the turtles lay their eggs are being squeezed on one side by development and on the other by the threat of rising sea levels as the oceans warm. Ultimately we must get a handle on those issues as well, or a creature that outlived the dinosaurs (恐龙) will meet its end at the hands of humans, leaving our descendants to wonder how creature so ugly could have won so much affection.

Passage TwoQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
There are few more sobering online activities than entering data into college-tuition calculators and gasping as the Web spits back a six-figure sum. But economists say families about to go into debt to fund four years of partying, as well as studying, can console themselves with the knowledge that college is an investment that, unlike many bank stocks, should yield huge dividends.
A 2008 study by two Harvard economists notes that the “labor-market premium to skill”―or the amount college graduates earned that’s greater than what high-school graduate earned―decreased for much of the 20th century, but has come back with a vengeance (报复性地) since the 1980s. In 2005, The typical full-time year-round U.S. worker with a four-year college degree earned $50,900, 62% more than the $31,500 earned by a worker with only a high-school diploma.
There’s no question that going to college is a smart economic choice. But a look at the strange variations in tuition reveals that the choice about which college to attend doesn’t come down merely to dollars and cents. Does going to Columbia University (tuition, room and board $49,260 in 2007-08) yield a 40% greater return than attending the University of Colorado at Boulder as an out-of-state student ($35,542)? Probably not. Does being an out-of-state student at the University of Colorado at Boulder yield twice the amount of income as being an in-state student ($17,380) there? Not likely.
No, in this consumerist age, most buyers aren’t evaluating college as an investment, but rather as a consumer product―like a car or clothes or a house. And with such purchases, price is only one of many crucial factors to consider.
As with automobiles, consumers in today’s college marketplace have vast choices, and people search for the one that gives them the most comfort and satisfaction in line with their budgets. This accounts for the willingness of people to pay more for different types of experiences (such as attending a private liberal-arts college or going to an out-of-state public school that has a great marine-biology program). And just as two auto purchasers might spend an equal amount of money on very different cars, college students (or, more accurately, their parents) often show a willingness to pay essentially the same price for vastly different products. So which is it? Is college an investment product like a stock or a consumer product like a car? In keeping with the automotive world’s hottest consumer trend, maybe it’s best to characterize it as a hybrid (混合动力汽车); an expensive consumer product that, over time, will pay rich dividends.

A) Huge amounts of money is being wasted on campus socializing.
B) It doesn’t pay to run into debt to receive a college education.
C) College education is rewarding in spite of the startling costs.
D) Going to college doesn’t necessarily bring the expected returns.
58. The two Harvard economists note in their study that, for much of the 20th century, ________.
A) enrollment kept decreasing in virtually all American colleges and universities
B) the labor market preferred high-school to college graduates
C) competition for university admissions was far more fierce than today

答案

　　On the Importance of a Name
A name is the representation of a person or an entity. It plays an important role in social recognition, just as the old saying goes: a thing is the entity of a name. However, people have diverse opinions on the importance of a name. Some people say that name is important, while the others maintain the other way round. But I think name is of great importance because it is the symbol that distinguishes one thing or person from the others.
We cannot deny the importance of a name, be it for a person or a thing. In the world today, no one can live without identification because they must get social recognition, and name is the symbol of the identification. Once a person or a thing gets social recognition, people will remember their names, and they will get further improvement. Besides, a good name will bring people some nice association. A person with a special name may be easily accepted by a group or a community because of the deep impression the name leaves.
As for companies or products, a name is also vitally important. Years ago, a computer company spent millions of dollars for the name “Acer”. Since then, the company caught the attention of potential customers and became one of giants in the field. However, another company was facing bankruptcy, for the name of its product implies unfavorable meaning thus cannot be sold out. Can we say that name is not important?
A name may affect the whole life of a person, and a name may also influence the future of a company and its products. Therefore, we must treat names carefully.

　　 Directions: In this part, you will have 15 minutes to go over the passage quickly and answer 


the questions on Answer Sheet 1. For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices 


marked A), B), C) and D). For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in 


the passage.
　　 Obama's success isn't all good news for black Americans
　　 As Erin White watched the election results head towards victory for Barack Obama, she felt a 


burden lifting from her shoulders. "In that one second, it was a validation for my whole race," she 


recalls.
　　 "I've always been an achiever," says White, who is studying for an MBA at Vanderbilt University 


in Nashville, Tennessee. "But there had always been these things in the back of my mind questioning 


whether I really can be who I want. It was like a shadow, following me around saying you can only 


go so far. Now it's like a barrier has been let down."
　　 White's experience is what many psychologists had expected - that Obama would prove to be a 


powerful role model for African Americans. Some hoped his rise to prominence would have a big 


impact on white Americans, too, challenging those who still harbour racist sentiments. "The traits 


that characterise him are very contradictory to the racial stereotypes that black people are 


aggressive and uneducated," says Ashby Plant of Florida State University. "He's very intelligent 


and eloquent."
　　 Sting in the tail
　　 Ashby Plant is one of a number of psychologists who seized on Obama's candidacy to test 


hypotheses about the power of role models. Their work is already starting to reveal how the "Obama 


effect" is changing people's views and behaviour. Perhaps surprisingly, it is not all good news: 


there is a sting in the tail of the Obama effect.
　　 But first the good news. Barack Obama really is a positive role model for African Americans, 


and he was making an impact even before he got to the White House. Indeed, the Obama effect can be 


surprisingly immediate and powerful, as Ray Friedman of Vanderbilt University and his colleagues 


discovered.
　　 They tested four separate groups at four key stages of Obama's presidential campaign. Each 


group consisted of around 120 adults of similar age and education, and the test assessed their 


language skills. At two of these stages, when Obama's success was less than certain, the tests 


showed a clear difference between the scores of the white and black participants―an average of 


12.1 out of 20, compared to 8.8, for example. When the Obama fever was at its height, however, the 


black participants performed much better. Those who had watched Obama's acceptance speech as the 


Democrats' presidential candidate performed just as well, on average, as the white subjects.After 


his election victory, this was true of all the black participants.
　　 Dramatic shift
　　 What can explain this dramatic shift? At the start of the test, the participants had to declare 


their race and were told their results would be used to assess their strengths and weaknesses. This 


should have primed the subjects with "stereotype threat" C an anxiety that their results will 


confirm negative stereotypes, which has been shown to damage the performance of African Americans.
　　 Obama's successes seemed to act as a shield against this. "We suspect they felt inspired and 


energised by his victory, so the stereotype threat wouldn't prove a distraction," says Friedman.
　　 Lingering racism
　　 If the Obama effect is positive for African Americans, how is it affecting their white 


compatriots (同胞)? Is the experience of having a charismatic (有魅力的) black president modifying 


lingering racist attitudes? There is no easy way to measure racism directly; instead psychologists 


assess what is known as "implicit bias", using a computer-based test that measures how quickly 


people associate positive and negative words―such as "love" or "evil"―with photos of black or 


white faces. A similar test can also measure how quickly subjects associate stereotypical traits―


such as athletic skills or mental ability―with a particular group.
　　 In a study that will appear in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Plant's team 


tested 229 students during the height of the Obama fever. They found that implicit bias has fallen 


by as much as 90% compared with the level found in a similar study in 2006. "That's an unusually 


large drop," Plant says.
　　 While the team can't be sure their results are due solely to Obama, they also showed that those 


with the lowest bias were likely to subconsciously associate black skin colour with political words 


such as "government" or "president". This suggests that Obama was strongly on their mind, says 


Plant.
　　 Drop in bias
　　 Brian Nosek of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who runs a website that measures 


implicit bias using similar test, has also observed a small drop in bias in the 700,000 visitors to 


the site since January 2007, which might be explained by Obama's rise to popularity. However, his 


preliminary results suggest that change will be much slower coming than Plant's results suggest.
　　 Talking honestly
　　 "People now have the opportunity of expressing support for Obama every day," says Daniel Effron 


at Stanford University in California. "Our research arouses the concern that people may now be more 


likely to raise negative views of African Americans." On the other hand, he says, it may just 


encourage people to talk more honestly about their feelings regarding race issues, which may not be 


such a bad thing.
　　 Another part of the study suggests far more is at stake than the mere expression of views. The 


Obama effect may have a negative side. Just one week after Obama was elected president, 


participants were less ready to support policies designed to address racial inequality than they 


had been two weeks before the election.
　　 Huge obstacles
　　 It could, of course, also be that Obama's success helps people to forget that a 


disproportionate number of black Americans still live in poverty and face huge obstacles when 


trying to overcome these circumstances. "Barack Obama's family is such a salient (出色的) image, we 


generalise it and fail to see the larger picture―that there's injustice in every aspect of 


American life," says Cheryl Kaiser of the University of Washington in Seattle. Those trying to 


address issues of racial inequality need to constantly remind people of the inequalities that still 


exist to counteract the Obama's effect, she says.
　　 Though Plant's findings were more positive, she too warns against thinking that racism and 


racial inequalities are no longer a problem. "The last thing I want is for people to think 


everything's solved."
　　 These findings do not only apply to Obama, or even just to race. They should hold for any role 


model in any country. "There's no reason we wouldn't have seen the same effect on our views of 


women if Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin had been elected," says Effron. So the election of a female 


leader might have a downside for other women.
　　 Beyond race
　　 We also don't yet know how long the Obama effect―both its good side and its bad―will 


last.Political sentiment is notoriously changeable: What if things begin to go wrong for Obama, and 


his popularity slumps?
　　 And what if Americans become so familiar with having Obama as their president that they stop 


considering his race altogether? "Over time he might become his own entity," says Plant. This might 


seem like the ultimate defeat for racism, but ignoring the race of certain select individuals―a 


phenomenon that psychologists call subtyping―also has an insidious (隐伏的) side. "We think it 


happens to help people preserve their beliefs, so they can still hold on to the previous 


stereotypes." That could turn out to be the cruellest of all the twists to the Obama effect.

　　 Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)
　　 Section A 
　　 Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete 


statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the 


fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
　　 Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
　　 Question: My ninth-grade art teacher doesn't give any grade above 94% because, she says, 


"There's always room for improvement." In previous years, I earned a 99% and a 100%. The 94 I 


received this term does not reflect the hard work that I put into this course. Because of her 


"improvement" theory, I got a lower grade than I deserve. Is her grading philosophy ethical (符合职


业道德规范的)?
　　 Answer: Your teacher's grading system may be unwise, but it is not unethical. A teacher 


deserves wide latitude in selecting the method of grading that best promotes learning in her 


classroom; that is, after all, the prime function of grades. It is she who has the training and 


experience to make this decision. Assuming that your teacher is neither biased nor corrupt and that 


her system conforms to school rules, you can't fault her ethics.
　　 You can criticize her methodology. A 100 need not imply that there is no possibility of 


improvement, only that a student successfully completed the course work. A ninth grader could get a 


well-earned 100 in English class but still have a way to go before she writes as well as Jane 


Austen. What's more, grades are not only an educational device but are also part of a screening 


system to help assign kids to their next class or program. By capping her grades at 94 while most 


other teachers grade on a scale that tops out at 100, your teacher could jeopardize a student's 


chance of getting a scholarship or getting into a top college.
　　 What it is wrong to condemn her for is overlooking your hard work. You diligence is worthy of 


encouragement, but effort does not equal accomplishment. If scholars suddenly discovered that 


Rembrandt had dashed off "The Night Watch" in an afternoon, it would still be "The Night Watch."
　　 I could spend months sweating over my own "paintings", but I'd produce something you wouldn't 


want to hang in your living room. Or your garage.
　　 One feature of a good grading system is that those measured by it generally regard it as fair 


and reasonable―not the case here. Simmering (难以平息的) resentment is seldom an aid to 


education.And so your next step should be to discuss your concerns with your teacher or the 


principal.

　　 47. The ninth-grader thought that his art teacher should have given him ______. 
　　 48. According to the answer, a teacher should have the freedom to ______ to encourage learning. 
　　 49. We learn from the answer that a student who gets a 100 should still work hard and keep 


______.
　　 50. The example of Rembrandt's painting suggests that a distinction should be made between 


______.
　　 51. The ninth-grader is advised to go to his teacher or the principal to ______.
　　 Section B 
　　 Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or 


unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should 


decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line 


through the centre.
　　 Passage One
　　 Questions 51 to 56 are based on the following passage. 
　　 Only two countries in the advanced world provide no guarantee for paid leave from work to care 


for a newborn child. Last spring one of the two, Australia, gave up the dubious distinction by 


establishing paid family leave starting in 2011. I wasn't surprised when this didn't make the news 


here in the United States―we're now the only wealthy country without such a policy.
　　 The United States does have one explicit family policy, the Family and Medical Leave Act, 


passed in 1993. It entitles workers to as much as 12 weeks' unpaid leave for care of a newborn or 


dealing with a family medical problem. Despite the modesty of the benefit, the Chamber of Commerce 


and other business groups fought it bitterly, describing it as "government-run personnel 


management" and a "dangerous precedent". In fact, every step of the way, as (usually) Democratic 


leaders have tried to introduce work-family balance measures into the law, business groups have 


been strongly opposed.
　　 As Yale law professor Anne Alstott argues, justifying parental support depends on defining the 


family as a social good that, in some sense, society must pay for. In her book No Exit: What 


Parents Owe Their Children and What Society Owes Parents, she argues that parents are burdened in 


many ways in their lives: there is "no exit" when it comes to children. "Society expects―and needs


―parents to provide their children with continuity of care, meaning the intensive, intimate care 


that human beings need to develop their intellectual, emotional and moral capabilities. And society 


expects―and needs―parents to persist in their roles for 18 years, or longer if needed."
　　 While most parents do this out of love, there are public penalties for not providing care. What 


parents do, in other words, is of deep concern to the state, for the obvious reason that caring for 


children is not only morally urgent but essential for the future of society. The state recognizes 


this in the large body of family laws that govern children' welfare, yet parents receive little 


help in meeting the life-changing obligations society imposes. To classify parenting as a personal 


choice for which there is no collective responsibility is not merely to ignore the social benefits 


of good parenting; really, it is to steal those benefits because they accrue (不断积累) to the 


whole of society as today's children become tomorrow's productive citizenry (公民). In fact, by 


some estimates, the value of parental investments in children, investments of time and money 


(including lost wages), is equal to 20-30% of gross domestic product. If these investments generate 


huge social benefits―as they clearly do―the benefits of providing more social support for the 


family should be that much clearer.

　　 52. What do we learn about paid family leave from the first paragraph? 
　　 A) America is now the only developed country without the policy. 
　　 B) It has now become a hot topic in the United States. 
　　 C) It came as a surprise when Australia adopted the policy. 
　　 D) Its meaning was clarified when it was established in Australia. 
　　 53. What has prevented the passing of work-family balance laws in the United States?

　　 B) The existing Family and Medical Leave Act. 
　　 C) The lack of a precedent in American history. 
　　 D) The opposition from business circles. 
　　 54. What is Professor Anne Alstott's argument for parental support? 
　　 A) The cost of raising children in the U. S. has been growing. 
　　 B) Good parenting benefits society. 
　　 C) The U. S. should keep up with other developed countries.

welfare?

　　 B) The fail to provide enough support for parents 
　　 C) They emphasize parents' legal responsibilities.

　　 56. Why does the author object to classifying parenting as a personal choice? 
　　 A) It is regarded as a legal obligation. 
　　 B) It relies largely on social support. 
　　 C) It generates huge social benefits. 
　　 D) It is basically a social undertaking. 
　　 Passage Two 
　　 Questions 57 to 62 are based on the following passage. 
　　 A new study from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement 


(CIRCLE) at Tufts University shows that today's youth vote in larger numbers than previous 


generations, and a 2008 study from the Center for American Progress adds that increasing numbers of 


young voters and activists support traditionally liberal causes. But there's no easy way to see 


what those figures mean in real life. During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama assembled a 


racially and ideologically diverse coalition with his message of hope and change; as the reality of 


life under a new administration settles in, some of those supporters might become disillusioned. As 


the nation moves further into the Obama presidency, will politically engaged young people continue 


to support the president and his agenda, or will they gradually drift away?
　　 The writers of Generation O (short for Obama), a new Newsweek blog that seeks to chronicle the 


lives of a group of young Obama supporters, want to answer that question. For the next three 


months, Michelle Kremer and 11 other Obama supporters, ages 19 to 34, will blog about life across 


mainstream America, with one twist: by tying all of their ideas and experiences to the new 


president and his administration, the bloggers will try to start a conversation about what it means 


to be young and politically active in America today. Malena Amusa, a 24-year-old writer and dancer 


from St. Louis sees the project as a way to preserve history as it happens. Amusa, who is traveling 


to India this spring to finish a book, then to Senegal to teach English, has ongoing conversations 


with her friends about how the Obama presidency has changed their daily lives and hopes to put some 


of those ideas, along with her global perspective, into her posts. She's excited because, as she 


puts it, "I don't have to wait [until] 15 years from　 now" to make sense of the world.
　　 Henry Flores, a political-science professor at St. Mary's University, credits this younger 


generation's political strength to their embrace of technology. "[The Internet] exposes them to 


more thinking," he says, "and groups that are like-minded in different parts of the country start 


to come together." That's exactly what the Generation O bloggers are hoping to do. The result could 


be a group of young people that, like their boomer (二战后生育高峰期出生的美国人) parents, grows up 


with a strong sense of purpose and sheds the image of apathy (冷漠) they've inherited from 


Generation X (60 年代后期和70 年代出生的美国人). It's no small challenge for a blog run by a group 


of ordinary―if ambitious―young people, but the members of Generation O are up to the task.

　　Due Attention Should Be Given To the Study of Chinese

　　1 近年来在学生中出现了忽视中文学习的现象；

　　2 出现这种现象的原因和后果；

　　3 针对这种现象，我认为……

　　Do you remember these famous litterateurs: Lu xun, Zhu zi qing, Lao she or Bing xin? How 


familiar these names are! Unfortunately, countless students pay no attention to the study of 


Chinese. Nowadays, Internet, English and game occupy students’ time and attention. For the 


majority of students, the study of Chinese has become a remote memory.

　　Why such a phenomenon emerges? Educators attribute it to the ignorance of university 


administration. Chinese is an essential course for college students in China. However, for a long 


time there has been a neglect in the study of Chinese. Taking a look around, every teacher 


encourages students to spend all time on learning English. On the contrary, none of them promotes 


students to learn Chinese. In the wake of this situation, students will make growing Chinese 


mistakes in spelling, reading and speaking. Maybe someday, Chinese would fade from historical 


stage.

　　In my opinion, some drastic measures should be taken. First of all, we can raise students’ 


awareness that the study of Chinese is indispensable to us. In addition, teachers can offer more 


courses related to Chinese or Chinese culture. Finally, we can promote CCT(college Chinese testing) 


. In a word, due attention should be given to the study of Chinese.
